<@1>Well, if it isn't you two again.<W> All
right, if you want your fortunes
told, solve this puzzle for me.
!******************************!
[e200_t1.txt]
<@1>Hurry up and solve this puzzle for
me before I change my mind.
!******************************!
[e200_t2.txt]
<@1>I wonder what I should make for
dinner tonight.
!******************************!
[e200_t3.txt]
<@1>There's going to be a lot of rain
tomorrow. Hang your washing inside
if you want it to dry.
!******************************!
[e200_t4.txt]
<@1>You're fated to be unhappy.
!******************************!
[e201_t0.txt]
<@3>Tee hee hee! Who are you looking
for this time?<W> Want to rest for a
minute and solve this puzzle?
!******************************!
[e201_t1.txt]
<@3>Oh, so now you come back? Could
you at least TRY to solve my puzzle
this time?
!******************************!
[e201_t2.txt]
<@3>Where's the fun in running around
trying to help other people?
Don't you feel sooo silly?
!******************************!
[e201_t3.txt]
<@3>Oh, you did it. OK, I guess I should
give you some info as a reward.<W>
!------------------------------!
You know Lady Dahlia, right? She's
planning to keep the fortune to
herself once it's found.<W>
!------------------------------!
And you've been helping her all
along.<W> Don't you feel sooo silly?
Tee hee hee!
!******************************!
[e201_t4.txt]
<@3>What, you're having trouble with
this little puzzle? Are you starting
to lose it, grandad?<W> Tee hee hee!
!******************************!
[e202_t0.txt]
<@3>Hee hee! Good afternoon, sir.<W>
Hey, I'll tell you a secret if you
solve this puzzle for me.<W>
!------------------------------!
It's a really tricky one!
!******************************!
[e202_t1.txt]
<@3>Hiya! Did you come back to solve
my puzzle?
!******************************!
[e202_t2.txt]
<@3>Be extra careful if you start
feeling tired or sick.<W> The monster
might come after you next!
!******************************!
[e202_t3.txt]
<@3>Wow, you're smart.<W> OK, come closer
so I can tell you my secret.<W>
!------------------------------!
I heard that all the people who get
kidnapped feel a little sick right
before they get taken!<W>
!------------------------------!
I bet the monster that lives up in
the tower feeds its victim nasty
food before it pounces!<W><@C>
Ooh, I bet it's, like, haggis ice
cream with gravy jelly.<W> Ugh.<W>
!------------------------------!
Or maybe he just picks the weakest
person to snatch.<W> But why would
he need all those people?
!******************************!
[e202_t4.txt]
<@3>You really don't get it?<W> Aww, and I
had such a great secret to share
with you too! Boo.
!******************************!
[e203_t0.txt]
<@3>Of course. If it has to do with
animals, leave it to me!<W>
!------------------------------!
By the way, Professor, have you
heard this one before?
!******************************!
[e203_t1.txt]
<@3>Oh, would you like to solve that
puzzle from before?
!******************************!
[e203_t2.txt]
<@3>There don't seem to be a lot
of animals around the village.
!******************************!
[e203_t3.txt]
<@3>Gosh, I was sure I'd come up with a
really good puzzle, but it was still
too easy, I suppose.
!******************************!
[e203_t4.txt]
<@3>Oh, I guess we have more important
things we should be doing...
!******************************!
[e203_t5.txt]
<@3>That cat and mouse seem to get
along pretty well, don't they?
!******************************!
[e203_t6.txt]
Do you think so, Luke?<W> I would have
guessed the cat was tormenting
that poor mouse.<W><@C>
But if you say the two of them are
friendly, I believe you.
!******************************!
[e203_t7.txt]
You're quite the animal lover,
aren't you, Luke?<W>
!------------------------------!
Now come along. We don't have time
to sit here and play around.
!******************************!
[e204_t0.txt]
<@1>Look at you fretting away there.
Whatever's the matter?
!******************************!
[e204_t1.txt]
Sorry to trouble you, but have you
seen Ramon around here today? He
was here until just a while ago.
!******************************!
[e204_t2.txt]
<@1>No, I can't say I've seen him today,
which is strange, considering how
often he sneaks off the job.<W>
!------------------------------!
But enough of that!<W> I hear you're
quite an ace with puzzles.<W>
!------------------------------!
Would you mind helping me out with
a puzzle I've been mulling over?
!******************************!
[e204_t3.txt]
Oh, right now? We're sort of in the
middle of something...
But if you insist...
!******************************!
[e204_t4.txt]
<@1>So you came back to take care of
that puzzle?
!******************************!
[e204_t5.txt]
<@1>You two are having a grand time
here, am I right?<W> With a girl like me
around, it'd be pretty hard NOT to!
!******************************!
[e204_t6.txt]
<@1>That's some fine work there. I was
stuck on this puzzle for I don't
know how long.<W>
!------------------------------!
Ah, you there, boy!<W> I just had a
terrible vision of you running into
trouble tonight.<W>
!------------------------------!
So be careful out there, all right?
!******************************!
[e204_t7.txt]
<@1>For shame!<W> A clever man like
yourself should be able to solve a
little puzzle like this.
!******************************!
[e204_t8.txt]
<@3>Well, that was a welcome piece of
news.<W> But don't worry about me,
because I don't get scared easily!
!******************************!
[e205_t0.txt]
<@1>Aw, and here I was thinking I was
about to get a big sale.<W> You've got
a hungry look about you, you know.<W>
!------------------------------!
Well, if I can't interest you with any
of my fine meat products, can I at
least tempt you with a puzzle?
!******************************!
[e205_t1.txt]
<@1>Oh, welcome back! Hankering for
another bite at this puzzle?
!******************************!
[e205_t2.txt]
<@1>You sure I can't interest you in a
nice cut of veal?<W> It's the veal deal!
Har har har!
!******************************!
[e205_t3.txt]
<@1>Hey, you're pretty good at this.<W> As
a bonus for solving my puzzle, I'll
throw in some gossip I heard.<W>
!------------------------------!
Word is that somebody lives in that
dark, grimy tower.<W>
!------------------------------!
You'd have to be a real oddball to
want to live in that old mouldy
wreck of a place.
!******************************!
[e205_t4.txt]
<@1>If you can't even solve this little
puzzle, I definitely wouldn't want to
"meat" you! Har har har!
!******************************!
[e205_t5.txt]
Sorry to disappoint you, sir, but we
didn't come here to shop.
!******************************!
[e205_t6.txt]
<@1>Oh, a customer! Welcome, welcome!<W>
!------------------------------!
I have some great deals on sausage
today. And my skirt steak will make
any plate a fashion plate! Har har!
!******************************!
[e206_t0.txt]
Ho ho! 'Lo there, Professor. You
look busy, as usual.<W> Why not sit down
with me for a quick puzzle? 
!******************************!
[e206_t1.txt]
Oh, welcome back there.
!******************************!
[e206_t2.txt]
If you don't want Lady Dahlia using
you for her own purposes, you
should keep your distance.
!******************************!
[e206_t3.txt]
Oh, wow, I can see why your name's
always in the papers.<W> You're a
clever one, aren't you!<W>
!------------------------------!
Well, you've impressed me, so let me
share a little gossip with you.<W>
!------------------------------!
She might look sweet as pie, but
believe me, Lady Dahlia of Reinhold
Manor is a cunning little thing.<W>
!------------------------------!
The moment the baron kicked the
bucket, that woman chased
away Flora!<W>
!------------------------------!
Yes, that Flora, the proper heir to
the Reinhold fortune!<W> I can see in
your face how scandalised you are!<W>
!------------------------------!
If you don't want to become a pawn
in her game, you'd best keep your
distance from her.
!******************************!
[e206_t4.txt]
You really can't solve this little
puzzle? Come on now! This should be
a breeze for someone like you!

like me park? Lovely, isn't it?<W>
!------------------------------!
The sun's shining bright today, and
I'm in fine spirits.<W>
!------------------------------!
Why not celebrate this weather with
a puzzle? Let me tell you one of
me favourites.
!******************************!
[e208_t1.txt]
So you missed me puzzle that much,
did you? Ha ha!
!******************************!
[e208_t2.txt]
Brings a tear to me eye to say so,
but parts of this park are simply
rotting away.<W>
!------------------------------!
If something looks old and broken,
be smart and stay away from it.
!******************************!
[e208_t3.txt]
Ha ha! You're quite the solver,
aren't you!<W>
!------------------------------!
Ah yes, getting back to me park. It
hasn't been properly maintained,
and parts are just rotting away.<W>
!------------------------------!
If something looks old and broken,
do the smart thing, lads, and stay
away from it.
!******************************!
[e208_t4.txt]
Is that it then?<W> No, I know you've
got this in you. Just concentrate,
and I know you two can do it!
!******************************!
[e209_t0.txt]
<@3>There seems to be a puzzle embedded
in this door. I could've sworn there
was nothing there a minute ago...
!******************************!
[e209_t1.txt]
Fascinating! This puzzle appears to
be acting as some sort of lock for
this door.<W> &SetAni 0 smile&How delightful!<W>
!------------------------------!
Luke, my boy, why don't you give this
puzzle a try?<W> I'm almost certain the
door will open if you solve it.
!******************************!
[e209_t2.txt]
Ready to try this one again, Luke?
!******************************!
[e209_t3.txt]
Very nice!<W> The door should open
right up now.

[e212_t0.txt]
Good day, gentlemen. How's your
investigation coming along?<W>
!------------------------------!
I can't imagine it's much fun asking
questions all day, so how about a
puzzle to liven things up? 
!******************************!
[e212_t1.txt]
Hello again. Did you come by to give
that puzzle another try?
!******************************!
[e212_t2.txt]
Do not be alarmed by my piercing
gaze.<W> This is for research
purposes only.
!******************************!
[e212_t3.txt]
Hmm. I guess the old advice to
write what you know doesn't apply
here. That was just too easy!<W>
!------------------------------!
You know, right now I'm penning a
mystery novel, and I'm basing the
protagonist on you.<W>
!------------------------------!
This is why I've been observing
you so carefully. In fact, the more I
see of you, the better.<W>
!------------------------------!
So, good luck with your search! I'll
be watching!
!******************************!
[e212_t4.txt]
I write a pretty mean puzzle, 
even if I do say so myself!
!******************************!
[e213_t0.txt]
Heh heh heh! I've been looking 
forward to another challenge! So, 
are you ready for a bit of chess?

Welcome back. Did you work out an
answer yet?

Yep, that's the answer, all right.
But just wait for the gem I'll have
ready for you next time.<W>
!------------------------------!
It's going to be so hard, it'll knock
your socks off!
!******************************!
[e213_t4.txt]
Nice try, but bad luck this time. But
if I know you boys at all, I know you
won't give up until you get it right.<W>
!------------------------------!
When you're ready to tackle this
puzzle, just swing by here again. You
know I'm always up for a game.
!******************************!
[e214_t0.txt]
OK, you two. We've had some good
times together, but this is the last
puzzle I've got for you.<W>
!------------------------------!
But don't be sad, because I'm about
to drop a beast of a puzzle on you.<W>
!------------------------------!
I guarantee you won't be able to
guess your way out of this one!<W>
So, are you ready?
!******************************!
[e214_t1.txt]
You had to come back, didn't you? I
could tell from the gleam in your
eyes that you were chess fiends!

Sorry to let you down, fellows, but
I'm all out of puzzles to give you.
!******************************!

You've done it! I knew you two were
chess masters under it all! I was
sure from our very first match.
!******************************!
[e214_t4.txt]
Giving up?<W> Well, I can't blame you,
seeing as I'm the only person I know
who's ever solved this puzzle.<W>
!------------------------------!
Don't let it bother you too much.
!******************************!
[e215_t0.txt]
<@1>AAUGH!<W> I can't sleep because of
this stupid puzzle! I've been thinking
about it for hours!<W>

there, pal. That was out of order.

it.<W> Some help you are!

darling of a puzzle and a mind to
share it with you.

you? Ha ha!

It's hard to sneak off when you're
above ground, as everyone can see
you plain as day.<W>

Now be good lads, and don't go
blabbing this to Rodney.

is just outside the manor, right?
We'll be there in no time.
!******************************!
[e221_t2.txt]
I'm so sorry to disappoint you,
Professor, but the master never
said anything of the sort to me.<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 1 sad&I'd very much like to help you in your
search, but my duties here prevent
me from leaving the grounds.
!******************************!
[e221_t3.txt]
If only Ingrid was around to provide
some assistance...
!******************************!
[e221_t4.txt]
I beg your pardon, sir... Ingrid?
!******************************!
[e221_t5.txt]
It's been years since she left, but
Ingrid used to work as a servant in
the mansion.<W>
!------------------------------!
She was Flora's nurse, and she
often helped me with my wor-

<@3>Matthew!
!******************************!
[e221_t7.txt]
Y...yes, My Lady! I'll be right there!
!******************************!
[e221_t8.txt]
Please excuse me, sir, the lady calls.<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 1 talk&If you're curious about Ingrid, why
not pay her a visit and talk to
her yourself?<W>
!------------------------------!
Let's see, at this time of day I'd
imagine she's out walking around by
the village shop.
!******************************!
[e221_t9.txt]
Please do me a favour and tell her
that I send my regards.
!******************************!
[e222_t0.txt]
<@3>Oh, goodness me, if it isn't Mr...erm,
Mr Layabout, was it?
!******************************!
[e222_t1.txt]
The name's Layton, madam.
!******************************!
[e222_t10.txt]
<@3>Some say Lady Dahlia put Flora on
the street to keep the family riches
to herself, but that's nonsense.<W>
!------------------------------!
After all, the baron cared about
Flora so much, I can't imagine that
he'd allow something like that.
!******************************!
[e222_t11.txt]
<@3>You know, you just reminded me.<W>
!------------------------------!
The grave of the baron's former 
wife is located in the manor garden.
I wonder who takes care of it now.
!******************************!
[e222_t12.txt]
The baron's former wife is buried in
the garden...
!******************************!
[e222_t13.txt]
Thank you, madam. You've been
extremely helpful.
!******************************!
[e222_t14.txt]
Luke, let's head back to the manor.<W>
!------------------------------!
I have a feeling that the grave
might hold the clue we've been
looking for.
!******************************!
[e222_t2.txt]
<@3>That's right, Mr Layton.<W> What can
I do for you, sir?
!******************************!
[e222_t3.txt]
Earlier we were talking with the
butler at Reinhold Manor, and he
mentioned you used to work there.<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 0 talk_hands&We'd very much like to hear anything
you might know about the baron.

!******************************!
[e222_t4.txt]
<@3>Heavens, you want to hear about
the baron?<W>
!------------------------------!
I'm afraid the only stories I have
are from when I worked at the
manor, and that was ages ago. 
!******************************!
[e222_t5.txt]
That would be ideal, madam. Would
you mind telling us one?
!******************************!
[e222_t6.txt]
<@3>All right, well... I suppose I could tell
you a bit about the baron and his
former wife.
!******************************!
[e222_t7.txt]
<@3>The way Master Reinhold and his
wife would carry on, they almost
seemed to be like children.<W><@C>
You'd never seen a man so in love
as Master Reinhold was.<W>
!------------------------------!
When she passed away, Flora was all
the baron had to remember her by.<W>
!------------------------------!
So he raised that little girl with all
the love a child could want.<W>
!------------------------------!
The things he'd bring home for her!
Toys from all over the world and
teddy bears as big as yourself!<W>
!------------------------------!
He was in high spirits in those days.
He really wanted to give her all the
affection in the world.
!******************************!
[e222_t8.txt]
So where has Flora gone?
!******************************!
[e222_t9.txt]
<@3>Your guess is as good as mine, sir.
I have no clue where that girl went.<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 1 talk&She left the mansion well after I
stopped working for the Reinholds. 

!******************************!
[e223_t0.txt]
<@3>Hmm? Oh, look, it's Matthew.
!******************************!
[e223_t1.txt]
Good day, Professor. Were you able
to track down Ingrid?
!******************************!
[e223_t10.txt]
<@3>This statue looks so much like Lady
Dahlia, it's hard to believe it's
someone else.
!******************************!
[e223_t11.txt]
Back when Flora was just a tiny
little thing, Lady Viola used to
take her to the park.<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 2 talk&Some of the flowers in the garden
grew from the ones Flora planted
here for her mother.
!******************************!
[e223_t12.txt]
Oh, I forgot to tell you about the
baron's diary. It should still be
on the desk in my lady's room.<W>
!------------------------------!
It's possible that it might contain
some information that could aid
your search for the Golden Apple.
!******************************!
[e223_t13.txt]
My thanks, Matthew. I'll be sure to
give it a once-over later. 
!******************************!
[e223_t14.txt]
Now then, Luke, we'd best head back
to Reinhold Manor.
!******************************!
[e223_t15.txt]
Here's the entrance, sirs.<W> Please
watch your step on the way in.
!******************************!
[e223_t2.txt]
Yes, we did. In fact, we were just
speaking with her.<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 0 talk&I mean no disrespect, but she said
the grave of the baron's former
wife lies on these grounds.<W>
!------------------------------!
Do you have any knowledge of this?
!******************************!
[e223_t3.txt]
Lady Viola's grave, sir? I was just
about to visit it myself.
!******************************!
[e223_t4.txt]
Would you mind if we came along to
take a look?
!******************************!
[e223_t5.txt]
Not in the slightest. Right this way.
!******************************!
[e223_t6.txt]
This is Lady Viola's grave.
!******************************!
[e223_t7.txt]
<@3>Gosh...this place is really nice!
It's not creepy at all.
!******************************!
[e223_t8.txt]
The late baron, rest his soul, told
me to keep this place in proper
order, and I have tried to do so.
!******************************!
[e223_t9.txt]
"Here sleeps Viola,
my one true love."
!******************************!
[e224_t0.txt]
This must be the diary that
Matthew spoke of.
!******************************!
[e224_t1.txt]
<@3>I have to admit, he seems to know
where everything in the manor is.
!******************************!
[e224_t10.txt]
Changed...its personality? I'm not
sure what the baron means, but 
this is clearly vital information.
!******************************!
[e224_t11.txt]
<@3>What do you suppose "it" refers to?
!******************************!
[e224_t12.txt]
<@3>He must've been terribly ill.
!******************************!
[e224_t13.txt]
<@3>But, Professor, how can we possibly
find that person with nothing but
this diary to go on?
!******************************!
[e224_t14.txt]
Ha ha! It's like I always say, Luke.<W>
Any good investigation starts on
the street.<W>
!------------------------------!
We'll just have to ask everyone in
the village about the matter.
!******************************!
[e224_t15.txt]
<@3>What?!<W>&SetAni 1 talk& I mean, of course! You're
absolutely right, Professor! Let's
get to it!
!******************************!
[e224_t16.txt]
Of course, any good investigation
also needs direction.<W>
!------------------------------!
Let's start out by asking Ingrid a
few questions. She seems to know a
great deal about Baron Reinhold.
!******************************!
[e224_t2.txt]
There's something about reading
someone else's diary that just
doesn't seem proper to me.<W>
!------------------------------!
However, the investigation must
continue, so...
!******************************!
[e224_t3.txt]
#rThe craftsmanship of it is simply
remarkable. It reminds me of my
sweet Viola when she was alive.#x
!******************************!
[e224_t4.txt]
#rFlora doesn't like the thing at all.
I've seen her run away from it on
multiple occasions.<W>
!------------------------------!
Recently, she spends more time
playing by dear Viola's grave than
anywhere else.<W>
!------------------------------!
I'm sad to say I doubt Flora will
ever take to it. I can't blame her,
as I've changed its personality.<W>
!------------------------------!
I felt terrible forcing that change
on Flora, but I just couldn't bear
to see it like that anymore.<W>
!------------------------------!
Viola...there can never be another
you. You were my first, my last, and
my only.#x&SetAni 2 book&
!******************************!
[e224_t5.txt]
#rI collapsed some days ago and have
been bedridden ever since. I feel as

Flora and care for her as I did...#x&SetAni 2 book&

Do you mean me, good sir?

[e225_t10.txt]
<@1>Too bad!<W> Not to bust your "chops"

Maybe you'd have said yes if you
knew what was at "steak"!
A har har har har!
!******************************!
[e225_t11.txt]
I think we're done here, Luke.
!******************************!
[e225_t12.txt]
<@3>I couldn't agree more, Professor.
!******************************!
[e225_t13.txt]
<@1>What, you don't know?<W> Don't let it
get you down.<W> No need to get all
broken up over a shattered vase!

<@1>Har har, back for more, are you?

[e225_t16.txt]
Er... I...don't think that's much of a

[e225_t17.txt]
<@1>That one was a little too highbrow
for you, eh?
!******************************!
[e225_t18.txt]
<@1>Hmph.
!******************************!
[e225_t2.txt]
<@1>Yep, you. This flower vase is yours,
right? I've been keeping it nice and
safe for you.
!******************************!
[e225_t3.txt]
<@1>I've never seen anyone just forget
something like this while shopping!

!******************************!
[e225_t4.txt]
I'm sorry, but you must be mistaken.
I've never seen that vase before in
my life...
!******************************!
[e225_t5.txt]
<@1>What?!<@W>2 This fancy vase DOESN'T
belong to you?<@W>2 So why'd that man
tell me to give this to you?
!******************************!
[e225_t6.txt]
Hm?!<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 0 talk&What did this man look like?
!******************************!
[e225_t7.txt]
<@1>Well my hat has a way of obscuring
certain details from me. It's the
"wurst", I tell you!<W> Har har!<W>
!------------------------------!
But back to the issue at hand.<W> The
mystery man wasn't a regular
'round here, that's for sure.<W>
!------------------------------!
Don't worry, though. I'll just give
it back to the guy next time I
see him.<W>
!------------------------------!
So, speaking of flower vases, I know
a puzzle I bet you'll like.<W>
!------------------------------!
It's not a hard one or anything, but
it's the least I can do for bothering
you about the vase.
!******************************!
[e225_t8.txt]
<@1>You've got a good head on your
shoulders. I'm impressed!<W>
!------------------------------!
By the way, you sure you don't want
to take some fresh sausage home
with you?<W>
!------------------------------!
Believe me, these are some links
you don't wanna be missing! Har har!
!******************************!
[e225_t9.txt]
No, thank you. We're just fine.
!******************************!
[e226_t0.txt]
<@3>Oh, what's this notebook?
!******************************!
[e226_t1.txt]
Did you find something interesting?
!******************************!
[e226_t2.txt]
<@3>I think so. This notebook looks like
someone's been using it as a diary.

#rJust a little longer now. Soon this
village will achieve the purpose
it was designed for.<W>

I've waited so long for this day,

little lonely.<W>

I hope that, at the very least, the
young mistress finally finds
happiness at the end of all this.#x

[e226_t4.txt]
<@3>This poor diary looks like it's
been through a lot. All the pages

Are you sure this is quite all
right, my lady? 
!******************************!
[e227_t1.txt]
<@3>Certainly. If leaving will make Flora
happy, I'd like nothing more than to
see her off with a smile.

[e228_t0.txt]
<@3>I hope I don't trip! This place is
pitch black!<W> Brrr! And it's cold too!

[e228_t1.txt]
Watch your step, Luke.<W> Look for
anything suspicious or out of place.
!******************************!
[e229_t0.txt]
<@3>Wow! I certainly didn't expect
to find a room down here.
!******************************!
[e229_t1.txt]
Let's give it a thorough once-over.<W>
Something isn't right about this
place. I can feel it in my bones.
!******************************!
[e230_t0.txt]
<@3>Look, Professor, there's a strange
device on the door here.
!******************************!
[e230_t1.txt]
Hmm... It seems to be a puzzle of
some sort. I imagine the door won't
open until we solve it.
!******************************!
[e230_t2.txt]
<@3>It's almost like we're being tested,
isn't it?
!******************************!
[e230_t3.txt]
All right, let's try this again.
!******************************!
[e230_t4.txt]
This puzzle is more difficult than I
expected. I'm actually perspiring!
!******************************!
[e230_t5.txt]
That should do the trick!
!******************************!
[e231_t0.txt]
<@3>Professor, look! The stairs are
barred off!
!******************************!
[e231_t1.txt]
Aha! This must be one of the puzzles
Bruno warned us about. It does look
quite difficult.
!******************************!
[e231_t10.txt]
Ha ha ha! Well, Luke, I don't have any
direct evidence of it, but I'd wager
that it was Bruno's doing.
!******************************!
[e231_t11.txt]
<@3>Bruno! But why in the world would
Bruno do something like that?
!******************************!
[e231_t12.txt]
Do you remember what he said?<W> It's
his duty to show the way to those
who seek the Golden Apple.<W>
!------------------------------!
But naturally, Bruno had no idea
what kind of people would come to
St Mystere seeking that treasure.<W>
!------------------------------!
It's likely he trapped us in the
village to buy himself some time to
evaluate who we were.<W>
!------------------------------!
He wanted to see if we were worthy
of the secret.
!******************************!
[e231_t13.txt]
<@3>That's terribly presumptuous of
him, don't you think?!<W>
!------------------------------!
How could he think either of us
were bad people?! He doesn't even
know us!
!******************************!
[e231_t14.txt]
Ha ha ha! Who knows how Bruno saw
it, Luke. I'm certain he was just
being careful.<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 0 talk&After all, Don Paolo managed to
sneak in with us.<W>
!------------------------------!
Bruno probably had his hands full
and needed time to see what kind of
people had entered the village.
!******************************!
[e231_t15.txt]
<@3>Oh, that reminds me, I wanted to
ask about that too...
!******************************!
[e231_t16.txt]
Luke, we really should get started
here.<W> You can ask me your next
question while we're climbing.
!******************************!
[e231_t17.txt]
There, there. Perhaps a little rest
will invigorate your brain.
!******************************!
[e231_t2.txt]
Well, my boy, are you ready for a
challenge?

!******************************!
[e231_t3.txt]
This puzzle is the key to the upper
floors of the tower.<W>
!------------------------------!
Without solving it, we'll never be
able to see what the rest of the
tower holds.
!******************************!
[e231_t4.txt]
There we are. Come on, Luke. We
must press on!
!******************************!
[e231_t5.txt]
<@3>All right! Lead the way, Professor.
!******************************!
[e231_t6.txt]
<@3>Say, Professor, there's something
that's been on my mind for a while.
!******************************!
[e231_t7.txt]
Oh? What is it, Luke?
!******************************!
[e231_t8.txt]
<@3>When the crank for the bridge was
stolen, we were sealed in the village
along with Don Paolo.
!******************************!
[e231_t9.txt]
<@3>It could be just me, but I feel like
this wasn't just a coincidence.<W>
Somebody planned it... But who?
!******************************!
[e232_t0.txt]
<@3>Aw, not another locked door!
Whoever built this tower must enjoy
watching people suffer. 
!******************************!
[e232_t1.txt]
Well, my boy, are you just going to
stand there and complain about it?
!******************************!
[e232_t10.txt]
<@3>Ugh... This puzzle is no joke!
!******************************!
[e232_t2.txt]
<@3>No!<W> Leave this puzzle to me!
!******************************!
[e232_t3.txt]
<@3>Please let me try again, Professor.
!******************************!
[e232_t4.txt]
<@3>I got it! The door's open now!
!******************************!
[e232_t5.txt]
Good show, Luke.<W> So what was it
you were asking me earlier? I'm all
ears now.
!******************************!
[e232_t6.txt]
<@3>I wanted to know when Don Paolo
snuck his way into the village. It
seems like he followed us here.<W>
!------------------------------!
The only way into St Mystere is
over the drawbridge...<W>
!------------------------------!
Plus, I doubt Franco would let in
such an obviously evil character as
Don Paolo.
!******************************!
[e232_t7.txt]
Yes, to be honest, I still haven't
quite worked out how Don Paolo
entered St Mystere myself.<W>
!------------------------------!
But it seems that after he made
his way in, he tried to stay at
Beatrice's inn.
!******************************!
[e232_t8.txt]
<@3>Oh, so that's the man who ran out
on his bill!<W> It makes sense that it 
was Don Paolo!<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 1 angry&So that weasel did himself up to
look like Inspector Chelmey, snuck
into the manor, and...<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 1 mouthopen&Hold on. When did he kill Simon?
!******************************!
[e232_t9.txt]
We'll get to that in a moment. We
must keep climbing.<W> Come along.
!******************************!
[e233_t0.txt]
Ah! Konnichiwa, amigos! I'm so glad
to see other people. I thought I'd be
wandering this place forever.
!******************************!
[e233_t1.txt]
<@3>H-hey, how did you get in here?<W>
There's no way you solved all
those puzzles...
!******************************!
[e233_t2.txt]
Je ne sais pas. It just happened. Un
momento. I'm wandering the sewers...
the next thing I know, I'm here.<W>
!------------------------------!
I take it that this isn't the "local
hotspot" my guidebook promised
it would be.
!******************************!
[e233_t3.txt]
...How curious.<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 0 talk_hands&So where is it you'd like to go? If
you go down these stairs, you can
return to the village.<W>
!------------------------------!
Just make sure you don't fall into
the large hole by the entrance.
!******************************!
[e233_t4.txt]
Ah, xie xie. That should be enough
information to get me there.<W> But
may I ask one more favour?<W>
!------------------------------!
All this talk of stairs has reminded
me of a nazo I know. Answer it
for me, por favor.
!******************************!
[e233_t5.txt]
I really would like you to solve this
puzzle for me. Comprendes?
!******************************!
[e233_t6.txt]
Grazie! Now I'm ready to go back to
the village.
!******************************!
[e233_t7.txt]
<@3>What a strange fellow...<W> &SetAni 1 think&Professor,
do you suppose that man is human?
!******************************!
[e233_t8.txt]
I believe so. He's an odd one though,
isn't he?<W>
!------------------------------!
I've never seen an explorer with
such a poor sense of direction.<W>
!------------------------------!
Stranger still is how he entered St
Mystere. I don't think even HE knows
how he did it.<W>
!------------------------------!
Perhaps his presence yesterday was
another reason why Bruno felt
compelled to hide the crank.
!******************************!
[e233_t9.txt]
I can't go back until you solve this
for me. It's muy importante!
!******************************!
[e234_t0.txt]
It seems that we're faced with
another puzzle lock, Luke.
!******************************!
[e234_t1.txt]
<@3>Oh! I meant to ask you, but our run-
in with that explorer distracted
me. How did Simon...you know?
!******************************!
[e234_t10.txt]
But that's not the whole mystery.
Come, Luke, we must keep moving.
I'll explain the rest as we go.
!******************************!
[e234_t11.txt]
Professor, are you telling me that
even you can't solve this puzzle?
!******************************!
[e234_t2.txt]
All in good time, my boy. First, we
need to solve this puzzle here. It
looks to be quite the challenge.
!******************************!
[e234_t3.txt]
All right, let's try this again,
shall we?
!******************************!
[e234_t4.txt]
There we are! The door should
open now.
!******************************!
[e234_t5.txt]
<@3>Amazing as always, Professor.<W> Now
about Simon. What exactly happened
at the manor?<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 1 mouthopen&Did Don Paolo really 
murd- um, do away with Simon?
!******************************!
[e234_t6.txt]
I'd say so.<W> This is just my theory,
mind you, but I think that Don Paolo
followed us into the manor.<W>
!------------------------------!
That's when he met Simon, or came
across him, as the case may be.<W><@C>
I suspect Simon had already
collapsed when Don Paolo found
his body sprawled on the floor.
!******************************!
[e234_t7.txt]
<@3>Just like with Ramon!<W> &SetAni 1 think&So maybe
Simon had also stopped functioning
properly, huh?<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 1 mouthopen&I guess all the robots break down
sooner or later, and when they do,
Bruno comes to collect them.<W>
!------------------------------!
Then he fixes them here in the
cellar of the tower.<W>
!------------------------------!
Oh! Do you suppose the noises from
the tower are actually the sounds
of Bruno's machines working?
!******************************!
[e234_t8.txt]
I think you're spot on, Luke.<W>
!------------------------------!
That must be why people began to
associate the disappearances with
the roaring from the tower.<W>
!------------------------------!
Don't forget that, despite his
peculiar appearance, Don Paolo
IS a scientific genius.<W>
!------------------------------!
Therefore, he probably realised
why Simon had stopped moving.<W>
!------------------------------!
If it weren't for the Golden Apple,
Don Paolo likely would have left
St Mystere right then.<W>
!------------------------------!
I'm sure he was eager to take
the robot apart and learn how
it worked.
!******************************!
[e234_t9.txt]
<@3>And that must be when he decided
to disguise himself as Inspector
Chelmey, right?<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 1 mouthopen&That rat made up the whole murder
story on the spot!
!******************************!
[e235_t0.txt]
Hyeh heh heh! Fanshy meeting you
here, dearie! How'd you like to try a
little puzzle I made up?
!******************************!
[e235_t1.txt]
<@3>H-how on earth did she get
up here?!
!******************************!
[e235_t2.txt]
Hmm, she must have overtaken us at
some point. Funny, I didn't even see
the old girl pass us.
!******************************!
[e235_t3.txt]
Hyem nyem nyem. &SetAni 2 talk&Quit whishpering
amongsht yourshelves and try my
puzzle already! It'sh a humdinger!
!******************************!
[e235_t4.txt]
Hyeh heh heh heh! Couldn't resisht
coming back for more, could you!
Go on, try again!
!******************************!
[e235_t5.txt]
Hyeh heh heh! Oh, yesh, that'sh the
answer, all right. Well then, I guesh
I'll be off. Come visit me shometime!<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 2 mumu&Hyem nyem nyem.

!******************************!
[e235_t6.txt]
<@3>I guess she followed us in here.
!******************************!
[e235_t7.txt]
Hyem nyem.<W> Oh, that shimply won't
do. I'm not budging until you sholve
my puzzle.
!******************************!
[e236_t0.txt]
<@3>Just like I thought. There's another
puzzle locking this door. It looks
really difficult, Professor.
!******************************!
[e236_t1.txt]
Luke, my boy, haven't you learned
by now?<W> No puzzle is without
an answer!<W>
!------------------------------!
Now, we simply need to find that
answer. Try your best!
!******************************!
[e236_t10.txt]
That's entirely possible, maybe even
probable, given the circumstances.<W>
!------------------------------!
But if so, what a terribly sad story
these entries tell. Do you remember
what the next entry said?
!******************************!
[e236_t11.txt]
#rFlora doesn't like the thing at all.
I've seen her run away from it on
multiple occasions.<W>
!------------------------------!
Recently, she spends more time
playing by dear Viola's grave than
anywhere else.<W>
!------------------------------!
I'm sad to say, but I doubt Flora will
ever take to it. I can't blame her,
as I've changed its personality.<W>
!------------------------------!
I felt terrible forcing that change
on Flora, but I just couldn't bear
to see it like that anymore.<W>
!------------------------------!
Viola...there can never be another
you. You were my first, my last, and
my only.#x
!******************************!
[e236_t12.txt]
The baron agreed to the
construction of a robot for Flora
that was identical to his late wife.<W>
!------------------------------!
But living with a machine that was
so similar to his wife must have
been too much for him.<W>
!------------------------------!
Thus, he decided to change the
robot's personality, and so Lady
Dahlia was created.<W>
!------------------------------!
As she was originally created as a
mother figure, she must've gone
through a confusing transition.
!******************************!
[e236_t13.txt]
<@3>Hmm... Professor, do you suppose
these robots feel sadness?
!******************************!
[e236_t14.txt]
Honestly, I'm not quite sure.<W>
!------------------------------!
But I have a feeling that each of
these robots has something not
unlike a human heart.<W>
!------------------------------!
What do you think?
!******************************!
[e236_t15.txt]
<@3>I...<W> I hope that they do.
!******************************!
[e236_t16.txt]
Why don't you rest for a moment,
my boy?
!******************************!
[e236_t2.txt]
I'm ready to try again, Professor!
!******************************!
[e236_t3.txt]
Creativity and persistence, Luke.
As long as you have these, no
puzzle is beyond you.
!******************************!
[e236_t4.txt]
<@3>Professor, I was just thinking.<W> Do
you remember that picture we found
in Lady Dahlia's room?
!******************************!
[e236_t5.txt]
The one of the baron's former wife,
Viola, holding a child who appears
to be the young Flora? Of course.
!******************************!
[e236_t6.txt]
<@3>That's the one. It's uncanny how
much Lady Viola looked like
Lady Dahlia.<W>
!------------------------------!
Do you suppose Baron Reinhold's
diary entries were talking about
Lady Dahlia?
!******************************!
[e236_t7.txt]
Sharp thinking, my boy. I believe it
went something like this:
!******************************!
[e236_t8.txt]
#rThe craftsmanship of it is simply
remarkable. It reminds me of my
sweet Viola when she was alive.#x
!******************************!
[e236_t9.txt]
<@3>That's the one that tipped me off.<W>
!------------------------------!
Professor, do you suppose Lady
Dahlia is actually a robot built to
resemble Lady Viola?
!******************************!
[e237_t0.txt]
<@3>Do you suppose we're near the
top yet?
!******************************!
[e237_t1.txt]
Yes, but it seems that we have
another puzzle in the way before
we get there.
!******************************!
[e237_t2.txt]
<@3>We've got to keep climbing. Let's
try this puzzle again.
!******************************!
[e237_t3.txt]
<@3>Now we're free to keep climbing.<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 1 mouthopen&You know, it's very odd how this
tower is simply huge, and yet there's
almost nothing inside it.
!******************************!
[e237_t4.txt]
Yes, quite. Other than Bruno's room
in the cellar, the whole place is
rather bare.<W>
!------------------------------!
Perhaps that is why Bruno's
machines make such a racket. This
tower is like a giant megaphone.
!******************************!
[e237_t5.txt]
<@3>But why would anyone want to
construct such a big, purposeless
tower, Professor?<W>
!------------------------------!
It's exhausting to climb this thing!
!******************************!
[e237_t6.txt]
Ha! Did you ever consider that this
tower might've been built for the
express purpose of exhausting us?<W>
!------------------------------!
This is just another one of the
many trials that have been set out
for seekers of the Golden Apple.
!******************************!
[e237_t7.txt]
<@3>Gosh, that makes perfect sense.<W>
Maybe that's also why the tower
looks so scary on the outside.
!******************************!
[e237_t8.txt]
This puzzle isn't to be taken lightly.
Let's rest for a moment.
!******************************!
[e238_t0.txt]
<@3>This floor doesn't appear to have
any puzzles for us.<W> So if we climb 
this spiral staircase, maybe...
!******************************!
[e238_t1.txt]
We'll reach the top floor? I think
you may be right, my boy.<W> Come,
let's hurry.
!******************************!
[e239_t0.txt]
<@3>Oh my gosh!
!******************************!
[e239_t1.txt]
Our view was obscured from the
ground, but who would've suspected
a charming cottage like this here? 
!******************************!
[e239_t2.txt]
<@3>Look! The lights are on, Professor.
!******************************!
[e239_t3.txt]
It would appear that someone is
living here.
!******************************!
[e240_t0.txt]
Excuse me. Are you by any chance
the park caretaker?
!******************************!
[e240_t1.txt]
.<@W>2.<@W>2.<@W>2Erm.
!******************************!
[e240_t10.txt]
Wait! Which way to the villaggio?<W>
Donde est[[3C]]'a[[3E]] the train station?!
!******************************!
[e240_t2.txt]
No.<W> I am an explorer of el mundo.
Right now, I am trying to familiarise
myself with the local culture.
!******************************!
[e240_t3.txt]
Oh, um... Well, please pardon my
mistake then. Have a pleasant
day, sir.
!******************************!
[e240_t4.txt]
Oh! Wait for one momento, s'il
vous pla[[3C]][[5E]]i[[3E]]t.<W>
!------------------------------!
I just saw a man in work clothes
pass here. Could he be the
caretaker you seek?
!******************************!
[e240_t5.txt]
He could be. Which way did he go?
!******************************!
[e240_t6.txt]
Probably to the right.<W> Pero, maybe
it was the left.
!******************************!
[e240_t7.txt]
I see...<W> Are you feeling all right? You
seem a bit...directionally challenged
for an explorer.
!******************************!
[e240_t8.txt]
I just arrived here after years of
world travel! Je ne sais pas the
local geographie here, that's all!
!******************************!
[e240_t9.txt]
I see. In that case, please forgive
me for making another assumption.<W>
!------------------------------!
Now please excuse us, as we need
to get going.
!******************************!
[e241_t0.txt]
<@1>I've always despised you, Layton!
!******************************!
[e241_t1.txt]
<@1>I thought I'd be able to crush you
once and for all here in St Mystere.<W>
!------------------------------!
But that will have to wait, since you
saw through my disguise.
!******************************!
[e241_t10.txt]
<@3>Hmm... Well that aside, what was all
that talk of a secret hidden in the
village? What was he referring to?
!******************************!
[e241_t11.txt]
I'm mystified by it myself.<W> For the
time being, though, let's focus on
finding the Golden Apple, shall we?
!******************************!
[e241_t12.txt]
I say we follow our newest lead and
head for that tower. Let's check
that dead end from before, Luke.
!******************************!
[e241_t13.txt]
Don Paolo is his name. I've heard
stories of him.<W>
!------------------------------!
His grasp of the hard sciences
is rumoured to be unrivalled.<W>
!------------------------------!
The problem, as you might guess, is
his personality. Though he is a
genius, the man is evil.<W>
!------------------------------!
The science board has banished him
from working officially in his field
ever again.<W>
!------------------------------!
Sneaking into St Mystere to steal
the Reinhold fortune sounds like
the kind of scheme he would hatch. 
!******************************!
[e241_t14.txt]
<@3>He seems to hold quite a grudge
against you, Professor. What did
you do to cross him?
!******************************!
[e241_t2.txt]
<@1>You haven't caught on yet, but
St Mystere hides a secret of
epic proportions. Nyeh heh heh!
!******************************!
[e241_t3.txt]
<@1>When I imagine a dimwit like you
trying to unravel the mystery, I
just have to smile. Nyeh heh heh!
!******************************!
[e241_t4.txt]
<@1>My business here for the day has
come to an end, so I'll be off now.<W>
!------------------------------!
But listen closely, Layton. Never
forget how close you came to
being bested!
!******************************!
[e241_t5.txt]
<@1>One day, I, the great Don Paolo, will
rain my vengeance down upon you!<W>
!------------------------------!
And on that fearful day, you will
BEG for an umbrella and a raincoat.
Perhaps even some galoshes!<W>
!------------------------------!
Nyeh heh heh heh heh!
!******************************!
[e241_t6.txt]
<@3>Gosh!
!******************************!
[e241_t7.txt]
Hm.
!******************************!
[e241_t8.txt]
<@3>I guess he's gone... Do you know
who that man was?
!******************************!
[e241_t9.txt]
I haven't the slightest idea, Luke.
!******************************!
[e242_t0.txt]
<@1>Keh heh heh. Well, don't you look
surprised! I bet you didn't expect to
see me in a place like this, eh?
!******************************!
[e242_t1.txt]
<@1>The river that encircles most of
St Mystere is right past this pipe.<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 0 angry&But don't you be getting any ideas!
You can't cross it.
!******************************!
[e242_t2.txt]
<@1>Give up on those ridiculous notions
of returning to the rest of the
world and settle down here!
!******************************!
[e242_t3.txt]
<@1>I suppose it's a tough transition to
make. Keh heh heh! Here's a puzzle
to help get you situated.
!******************************!
[e242_t4.txt]
Event Text242_4[[0D]]

!******************************!
[e242_t5.txt]
<@1>Keh heh heh! You've got to admit,
moving somewhere new can be a lot
of fun, eh?<W>
!------------------------------!
Solve this puzzle and you'll be
ready to go!
!******************************!
[e242_t6.txt]
<@1>I can tell from the look on your
face that you're dying to live by
my house, aren't you!
!******************************!
[e242_t7.txt]
<@1>Keh heh heh! Well done.<W> I like the way
you get all fired up over puzzles.
&SetAni 0 angry&You're my kind of man!
!******************************!
[e242_t8.txt]
<@1>So hurry up and get settled!
St Mystere is happy to
have you!
!******************************!
[e242_t9.txt]
<@1>Too hard for you, eh?<W> &SetAni 0 angry&For shame! I
thought you were cleverer
than that!
!******************************!
[e243_t0.txt]
Oh goodness, whatever shall I do?
!******************************!
[e243_t1.txt]
What seems to be the trouble, sir?
!******************************!
[e243_t10.txt]
Splendid! I'll wait right here for you
to come back. I'm counting on you!
!******************************!
[e243_t11.txt]
One more detail, please, sir. What
exactly did you drop?
!******************************!
[e243_t12.txt]
Drop? I...<W> Oh my, now what WAS it?<W>
Errrm...<W>
!------------------------------!
Oh, that's right. It was my watch,
actually, my BEST wristwatch. Bring
it back for me, laddie.
!******************************!
[e243_t13.txt]
Event Text243_13[[0D]]

!******************************!
[e243_t2.txt]
Let's see here. Strong, young, and
you look like you have a good back.<W>
Oh, thank heavens you came along!
!******************************!
[e243_t3.txt]
I beg your pardon?
!******************************!
[e243_t4.txt]
I've searched everywhere, and I just
can't find the thing.<W>
!------------------------------!
Oh, I suppose I must've dropped it
when I was out strolling by the park
this afternoon.<W>
!------------------------------!
I would go search for it myself, but
it's dark outside now.
!******************************!
[e243_t5.txt]
<@3>It IS awfully scary out there!
!******************************!
[e243_t6.txt]
Bah, nothing of the sort!<W><@C>
It's just that, well, I'm no spring
chicken anymore, and my eyes aren't
as sharp as they used to be.<W>
!------------------------------!
So how about it, laddie?<W> Will you
help out an old man and go search
in front of the park for me?
!******************************!
[e243_t7.txt]
<@3>What?!<W> But we are in the middle of
our investigation right now...
!******************************!
[e243_t8.txt]
Now, now, Luke. No need to be rude.
After all, the park is but a small
way away.<W>
!------------------------------!
And who knows, we might actually
find some new information to aid
our case there.
!******************************!
[e243_t9.txt]
Besides, helping those in need is the
duty of any gentleman.
!******************************!
[e245_t0.txt]
Oh, look, a candle, Luke.<W>
That reminds me... Have you heard
this one before?
!******************************!
[e245_t1.txt]
That's all right, my boy. Just give it
another try.
!******************************!
[e245_t2.txt]
It's a candle, all right.
!******************************!
[e245_t3.txt]
Wonderful work, Luke. That is indeed
the answer!<W>
!------------------------------!
I don't see anyone minding the shop
at the moment. Perhaps we should
leave for now.
!******************************!
[e245_t4.txt]
That's all right, my boy. Maybe you
should give it some more thought.
!******************************!
[e246_t0.txt]
That reminds me. Luke, have you
heard the wonderful puzzle about
the Ferris wheel?
!******************************!
[e246_t1.txt]
Would you like to try the Ferris
wheel puzzle again?
!******************************!
[e246_t2.txt]
It's a lovely Ferris wheel. What a
shame it's in such disrepair.
!******************************!
[e246_t3.txt]
Excellent job, my boy.
!******************************!
[e246_t4.txt]
Think hard about this one.
!******************************!
[e246_t5.txt]
Though I can't put my finger on it,
there's something quite odd about
this Ferris wheel.<W>
!------------------------------!
It makes me wonder if we might have
overlooked something important
around the park.
!******************************!
[e246_t6.txt]
We should take another quick look
around the area to make sure we
haven't missed an important clue.
!******************************!
[e246_t7.txt]
<@3>Aw, I was looking forward to riding
the Ferris wheel...
!******************************!
[e246_t8.txt]
<@3>That poor Ferris wheel is totally
destroyed now.
!******************************!
[e247_t0.txt]
<@1>Lend me an ear, would you?<W> I'd like
your expert opinion on this puzzle.
It won't take but a minute.
!******************************!
[e247_t1.txt]
<@1>Oh, are you here again to see me?
!******************************!
[e247_t2.txt]
<@1>Oh, hello again. How are you today?
!******************************!
[e247_t3.txt]
<@1>Mm hmm.<W> I guess I was on the right
track all along. Thanks for your
help, boys.<W>
!------------------------------!
Sorry for taking up so much of your
time. I'll let you get back to what
you were doing. Good day.
!******************************!
[e247_t4.txt]
<@1>Come by and see me again. I don't
plan on going anywhere today, so
you should be able to find me here.
!******************************!
[e248_t0.txt]
That clock tower looks rather worse
for wear. <W>Speaking of clocks,
I've got just the puzzle for you!
!******************************!
[e248_t1.txt]
Right, let's try this one again!
!******************************!
[e248_t2.txt]
That clock tower has certainly
seen better days.
!******************************!
[e248_t3.txt]
Precisely the answer I was looking
for, Luke. Well done, my boy.
!******************************!
[e248_t4.txt]
Don't get discouraged. Collect your
thoughts and try again.
!******************************!
[e249_t0.txt]
I certainly didn't foresee sewers
leading to a place like this.<W>
!------------------------------!
Look, there's the Laytonmobile.
!******************************!
[e249_t1.txt]
Ready to try your hand at that
puzzle again?
!******************************!
[e249_t2.txt]
<@3>I sure hope nothing bad happens to
the Laytonmobile while we're away.
It's been parked up quite a while.
!******************************!
[e249_t3.txt]
Sterling work, Luke. 
!******************************!
[e249_t4.txt]
Don't get discouraged. Collect your
thoughts and try again.
!******************************!
[e250_t0.txt]
Am I glad to see you, Professor!<W> I
seem to have gotten myself into
another pickle.<W>
!------------------------------!
I know you're busy and all, but I just
can't find the answer to this puzzle.
Could you give me a hand with it?
!******************************!
[e250_t1.txt]
Care to chew on this one for a
little longer?
!******************************!
[e250_t2.txt]
I'm all out of puzzles right now.
Care to sample the soup du jour?
!******************************!
[e250_t3.txt]
Ah, so that's how it's done. Thanks
again, Professor.
!******************************!
[e250_t4.txt]
No luck, huh?<W>
!------------------------------!
Well don't let it bother you. I'll see
if I can't think this one through
myself. Thanks anyway, though.
!******************************!
[e251_t0.txt]
<@3>Wow, look at those flowers! They
sure are pretty!
!******************************!
[e251_t1.txt]
Indeed they are. I'm sure someone
put a lot of work into them.<W>
Oh, that reminds me...<W>
!------------------------------!
Would you like to hear a puzzle
about growing flowers?
!******************************!
[e251_t2.txt]
<@3>You bet, Professor! Let's hear it!
!******************************!
[e251_t3.txt]
Ready to try this puzzle again?
!******************************!
[e251_t4.txt]
The garden here is immaculate. 
!******************************!
[e251_t5.txt]
Correct. Good thinking, Luke.
!******************************!
[e251_t6.txt]
<@3>I'd like to try that puzzle some
other time, Professor.
!******************************!
[e252_t0.txt]
Bookshelves seem to line every wall
of this estate. The baron must
have been quite the avid reader.<W>
!------------------------------!
It's important to keep your mind
sharp, Luke. So why don't you give
this puzzle a go?
!******************************!
[e252_t1.txt]
Why don't you give it another try?
!******************************!
[e252_t2.txt]
<@3>Gosh, look at all these books. There
have got to be hundreds of them.
!******************************!
[e252_t3.txt]
How did you like the puzzle, Luke?
I hope it has prepared you for
tackling more difficult puzzles.
!******************************!
[e252_t4.txt]
Take a deep breath and think
carefully about the puzzle.
You can always try again later.
!******************************!
[e253_t0.txt]
Those sweets look absolutely
scrumptious, don't they?<W>
!------------------------------!
Luke, those sweets just gave me a
splendid idea for a puzzle. Have a
listen to this.
!******************************!
[e253_t1.txt]
Would you like to hear my sweets
puzzle again?
!******************************!
[e253_t2.txt]
<@3>Those sweets do look delicious.
Especially the strawberry ones.
Those are my favourite!
!******************************!
[e253_t3.txt]
There we are. Once you discern what
the question is saying, the problem
is a rather simple one, isn't it?
!******************************!
[e253_t4.txt]
With a little more thought, I'm sure
you can find the answer to this one.
!******************************!
[e254_t0.txt]
<@1>Hey, Professor, did you find what
you were after?<W>
!------------------------------!
Never mind that, though. I've got
something more important to talk
about.<W> Namely, chocolate.<W>
!------------------------------!
Help me solve this puzzle, and I'll tell
you something I bet you'll find
VERY interesting.
!******************************!
[e254_t1.txt]
<@1>Back for another bite at that
puzzle, yeah?
!******************************!
[e254_t2.txt]
<@1>Crouton makes grub that's outta
this world! I could eat at his place
every day and not get sick of it.
!******************************!
[e254_t3.txt]
<@1>Now it makes sense!<W> OK, now about
that hot info I promised.<W>

If you want to experience the best
dining in St Mystere, you've got to
check out Crouton's restaurant.<W>
!------------------------------!

Don't even get me started on the
stews! You have to try it yourself.

Indeed.<W> From here, you can take

<@3>We'd sure like to show you more,

at this time.

[e259_t4.txt]
We look forward to seeing you for

[e260_t0.txt]
<@1>Hey, Professor, I've been
waiting for someone like you.<W>
!------------------------------!
Listen, I've got something VERY
interesting to tell you if you solve
this puzzle here.
!******************************!
[e260_t1.txt]
<@1>You're here to solve my puzzle, eh?
!******************************!
[e260_t2.txt]
<@1>I've got it all worked out, you know.<W>
!------------------------------!
The best times in life are when
you're eating good food. Omnomnom!
!******************************!
[e260_t3.txt]
<@1>Oh, I see now. Heck, is that really
all I needed to do to solve it?<W>
!------------------------------!
Oh yeah, I promised to tell you
something, didn't I? Well,
listen here.<W>
!------------------------------!
The greatest culinary delight in all
of St Mystere is Crouton's ginger
pudding. It's delish!<W>
!------------------------------!
Ironically, the worst thing you could
ever put in your mouth is also a
dish of Crouton's.<W>
!------------------------------!
Honestly, you could choke a donkey
with those scones.<W> Yuck...
!******************************!
[e260_t4.txt]
<@1>Come on! I'll scratch your back if
you scratch mine, but I can't say
anything until you solve my puzzle.
!******************************!
[e261_t0.txt]
<@1>...Oh dear. Your fortune for this
month looks abysmal.<W>
!------------------------------!
I recommend solving my puzzle if you
want to avoid this terrible,
potentially gory, fate.
!******************************!
[e261_t1.txt]
<@1>You don't want to have the worst
month of your life, do you?<W> Right,
so solve this puzzle now.
!******************************!
[e261_t2.txt]
<@1>I hope you don't mind if I call
on you the next time I come up
against a stubborn puzzle.
!******************************!
[e261_t3.txt]
<@1>My, that was quick.<W> Were you that
scared of a month's worth of
bad luck?<W>
!------------------------------!
Well, I'm sorry to say that there's
nothing you can do to change fate.
You have to just grin and bear it.
!******************************!
[e261_t4.txt]
<@1>So you really don't care if you
suffer through the most horribly
unlucky month of your life?<W>
!------------------------------!
That's very brave of you.
!******************************!
[e262_t0.txt]
<@3>Look at how old this picture is.<W>[[0D]]
Hey, Professor, do you want to[[0D]]
try a really difficult puzzle?
!******************************!
[e262_t1.txt]
<@3>Let me show you that puzzle again.
!******************************!
[e262_t2.txt]
<@3>I wonder what this painting
represents?
!******************************!
[e262_t3.txt]
<@3>Oh, I didn't think it was THAT easy!
!******************************!
[e262_t4.txt]
<@3>It's a good one, right? It's got to
be one of the top five hardest
riddles I know!
!******************************!
[e263_t0.txt]
<@3>Huh?<W> Look, there's a hole in that
boat there.<W>
!------------------------------!
Oh, Professor, that reminds me!
Have you ever heard the one about
the sinking ship?
!******************************!
[e263_t1.txt]
<@3>Please let me show you the sinking
ship puzzle again, Professor.
!******************************!
[e263_t2.txt]
<@3>This boat looks like it's covered 
with holes. It must be absolutely 
ancient.
!******************************!
[e263_t3.txt]
<@3>Wow, great answer, Professor! It
took me five times as long to get
that one.
!******************************!
[e263_t4.txt]
<@3>I'll keep this puzzle in mind for
later. You can try it again then.

that I show you this puzzle.<W>
!------------------------------!
Will you triumph, or will the gaping
maw of fate swallow you whole?
!******************************!
[e264_t1.txt]
<@1>Fate has brought you and this
puzzle together once again.
!******************************!
[e264_t2.txt]
<@1>I'm all out of puzzles to show you
right now. Go ask elsewhere if
you're looking for a new challenge.
!******************************!
[e264_t3.txt]
<@1>Goodness, I can't believe you solved
it!<W> It was meant to be!<W>
!------------------------------!
I tell you what, since you went and
solved my puzzle, I'll read your palm.
Give me your hand now.<W>
!------------------------------!
Hmm... It seems that calamity follows
you wherever you go. Try your best
to stay out of harm's way.
!******************************!
[e264_t4.txt]
<@1>You don't need to be a clairvoyant
like me to see that you're giving
up on this one.
!******************************!
[e265_t0.txt]
I am responsible for managing the
influx and outflux of residents in
St Mystere.<W>
!------------------------------!
In other words, I supervise who gets
to stay in this village and who has
to be shown the door.<W>
!------------------------------!
If you wish to stay in St Mystere,
I strongly advise that you butter
me up by solving this puzzle.
!******************************!
[e265_t1.txt]
If you solve this puzzle, I think I'd be
willing to approve your request to
stay in St Mystere.
!******************************!
[e265_t2.txt]
It is my constant vigilance that
lets Lady Dahlia live comfortably
in this village.<W>
!------------------------------!
When you see her, I strongly advise
that you let her know how hard I've
been working.
!******************************!
[e265_t3.txt]
Ah yes, that's the answer. Very well
then, I approve your application to
visit St Mystere.<W>
!------------------------------!
But when you have finished your
business here, I strongly advise
you to leave the village.
!******************************!
[e265_t4.txt]
If this puzzle is too hard, I strongly
advise you to pack your things and
go back to where you came from.
!******************************!
[e266_t0.txt]
<@1>Heya, I see you're busy investigating
as always, yeah? Yeah, yeah,
'course you are.<W>
!------------------------------!
Thing is, I've got a hot puzzle here,
and there's no way I'm waiting until
later to show you.<W>
!------------------------------!
So hold that investigation, Prof.
You've got a puzzle to solve.
!******************************!
[e266_t1.txt]
<@1>Stepping back into the ring, are
you?<W> Yeah, you're a fighter, aren't
you! Good, very good!
!******************************!
[e266_t2.txt]
<@1>I don't know anything. You hear me?
No leads here, not one! 
!******************************!
[e266_t3.txt]
<@1>Hey, nice one. You're pretty nifty
with puzzles. I guess that's why you
got that top hat, huh? Thought so!<W>
!------------------------------!
All right then, Prof, since you did
such a good job, I suppose I'll let
you continue your investigation.
!******************************!
[e266_t4.txt]
<@1>Nyeh heh heh! Is that the best you
can do?<W> I've got to be honest.
I'm not impressed.
!******************************!
[e267_t0.txt]
Ooh! Let me have a word with you
for a minute there, laddie!<W>
!------------------------------!
I'm all turned around on this one
issue, and I need someone with a
level head to help me out.<W>
!------------------------------!
See, it all started a while back when
I was on holiday and bought
this camera case.<W>
!------------------------------!
I think that sneaky merchant
swindled me out of a few pounds.
!******************************!
[e267_t1.txt]
Help me out here, laddie. I think
I got conned on holiday, but I'm
not sure.
!******************************!
[e267_t2.txt]
What has this world come to?
!******************************!
[e267_t3.txt]
The nerve of that crook!<W> And I
thought I was getting the deal of
the century!<W>
!------------------------------!
It really saddens a man to think
that people can be so dishonest.
!******************************!
[e267_t4.txt]
What's the matter, laddie? I
thought you were going to help me
work this out.
!******************************!
[e268_t0.txt]
<@3>Hey, mister.<W> I've got a great puzzle
for you. If you solve it, I'll tell you
a REEEALLY big secret.
!******************************!
[e268_t1.txt]
You want to try my puzzle again?
!******************************!
[e268_t2.txt]
If I hear another good puzzle, I'll be
sure to show it to you, OK?
!******************************!
[e268_t3.txt]
Wow, that was fast!<W> Okeydokey,
ready to hear my secret?<W>
!------------------------------!
You know Lady Dahlia, right? Well,
turns out she's not as mean as
people make her out to be.<W>
!------------------------------!
In fact, I bet she's really a nice
lady.<W> I bet you a million picarats.
!******************************!
[e268_t4.txt]
You really don't know the answer?<W>
Too bad for you then. I guess you
don't get to hear my secret...
!******************************!
[e269_t0.txt]
<@3>Hey, mister. It's good to see you
again.<W> See, I'm totally stuck here,
and I could really use your help.<W>
!------------------------------!
My friend told me this puzzle the
other day, and I just can't solve
the thing.<W> Can you help me?
!******************************!
[e269_t1.txt]
<@3>Can you give me the answer to that
puzzle I was telling you about?
!******************************!
[e269_t2.txt]
<@3>Adrea's really nice, but she comes
up with some tough puzzles!
!******************************!
[e269_t3.txt]
<@3>Oh, is that all you had to do to
work it out? Why didn't I think
of that?<W>
!------------------------------!
Can you keep a secret?<W> Don't tell
Adrea you told me the answer, OK?
Thanks, mister!
!******************************!
[e269_t4.txt]
<@3>I guess it's even tougher than I
thought.<W> Maybe I just need to think
about it more.
!******************************!
[e270_t0.txt]
<@1>No matter how I try, I just can't
seem to find that special someone.<W>
!------------------------------!
Tell me, Professor, what does an
eligible bachelor like myself have to
do to find a girl?<W>
!------------------------------!
I had an epiphany the other day. I
think the reason I'm alone is
because I can't solve this puzzle.<W>
!------------------------------!
Oh, how I've tried to solve it! But
no matter how many nights I spend
pondering it, the answer eludes me!<W>
!------------------------------!
Please help me, Professor. I don't
want to spend the rest of my life
talking to my stuffed animals.
!******************************!
[e270_t1.txt]
<@1>Do solve that puzzle we spoke of
for me. I'm begging you, Professor!<W>
!------------------------------!
As soon as it's out of the way, I'll
be so popular that I'll need a stick
to keep the bachelorettes away!
!******************************!
[e270_t2.txt]
<@1>Look at me, sir. My shoes cost a
month's lodging, yet no one wants to
marry this handsome bachelor.<W><@C>
What am I doing wrong?<W> Tell me the
truth, Professor.<W> Is it my...hat?
!******************************!
[e270_t3.txt]
<@1>Oh, joy! I'm positively tingling with
excitement! With that puzzle solved,
I'm sure I'll find a bride in no time!
!******************************!
[e270_t4.txt]
<@1>You mustn't give up on me like that!<W>
My happiness, nay, my entire legacy,
hinges on you solving this puzzle!
!******************************!
[e271_t0.txt]
<@1>Mr Layton, you have some skill at
solving puzzles, yes?<W>
!------------------------------!
I have a puzzle here that even
I was momentarily troubled by.<W>
!------------------------------!
Let's see how you fare against it.
!******************************!
[e271_t1.txt]
<@1>Ah, so you've returned to redeem
yourself, eh?<W> We wouldn't want your
reputation to suffer, would we?<W>
!------------------------------!
Go on, solve the puzzle already!

!******************************!
[e271_t2.txt]
<@1>You needn't worry. I assure you I
will find Simon's killer myself.<W>
!------------------------------!
For now, just let me do my job and
go back to your search for that
Golden Apple. 
!******************************!
[e271_t3.txt]
<@1>Impressive, Mr Layton. It seems the
rumours touting your skill weren't
totally unfounded.<W>
!------------------------------!
But don't go getting any ideas.
Do the smart thing and leave the
detective work to me.<W>
!------------------------------!
In the meantime, you can occupy
yourself by searching for the
Golden Apple. 
!******************************!
[e271_t4.txt]
<@1>This is the work of the best
puzzle solver in all of London?<W> Come
now, surely you can do better. 
!******************************!
[e272_t0.txt]
<@1>Hey there, Professor. I bet you're
here to solve my puzzle. I'm right,
aren't I? Yeah, of course I'm right.
!******************************!
[e272_t1.txt]
<@1>Gonna give this puzzle another
spin? Is that right? Yeah, that's
what I thought.
!******************************!
[e272_t2.txt]
<@1>Lady Dahlia sure is gorgeous, ain't
she? Yep, sure is. What a stunner.
What a vision.<W>
!------------------------------! Girls like that are
pretty rare, I tell you. Yep, yep.
!******************************!
[e272_t3.txt]
<@1>Great job there, Professor. Even
that puzzle didn't faze you, huh?<W>
'Course not, you're a pro!<W>
!------------------------------!
Yep, you're a real piece o' work,
Prof. You know that?<W> 'Course you
do. You're a scholar, after all!
!******************************!
[e272_t4.txt]
<@1>What?<W> You really can't solve
my puzzle? I feel let down, Prof.
Badly let down, I tell you.
!******************************!
[e273_t0.txt]
<@1>Oh, Professor, you just simply have
to help me. I've got another puzzle
on my hands I just can't solve.<W>
!------------------------------!
As a man of the world, you know
there's nothing women find more
alluring than...competence.<W>
!------------------------------!
I'm counting on you, sir! Don't doom
me to an eternal bachelorhood!
!******************************!
[e273_t1.txt]
<@1>Oh, thank goodness you're back. Do
give this puzzle another try, please.
Being alone is so very lonely.
!******************************!
[e273_t2.txt]
<@1>As much as I'd like to marry, if my
betrothed were as wild a spender as
Lady Dahlia, I'd rather stay single.<W>
!------------------------------!
But please continue to keep your
eye out for a special lady for me...<W>
!------------------------------!
And just so we're clear, it certainly
wouldn't hurt if she was a bit of
a penny-pincher...
!******************************!
[e273_t3.txt]
<@1>Thanks, old boy! With this puzzle
solved, I feel I'm one step
closer to the altar.
!******************************!
[e273_t4.txt]
<@1>You mustn't give up! Would you have
me be single forever? Please come
back and solve this puzzle soon.
!******************************!
[e274_t0.txt]
<@1>Oh, dear! I'm stumped again!<W> And I
just know I'll never find a bride of
my own if I don't solve this puzzle!<W>
!------------------------------!
I'll spend my golden years alone,
with only the smell of cats and
boiled sweets to keep me company.<W>
!------------------------------!
I beseech you, Professor, help me
solve this puzzle.
!******************************!
[e274_t1.txt]
<@1>Please hurry and solve this puzzle
for me. I tire of the bachelor's
life.
!******************************!
[e274_t2.txt]
<@1>Would you please let me know of
any eligible bachelorettes you might
meet on your travels?
!******************************!
[e274_t3.txt]
<@1>Oh, happy day!<W> With that puzzle out
of the way, I'm confident that no
woman will be able to resist me!<W>
!------------------------------!
I'll be bidding my loneliness goodbye
before I know it.
!******************************!
[e274_t4.txt]
<@1>Honestly, Professor, do you want me
to spend my old age with a dozen
cats? Is that it?
!******************************!
[e275_t0.txt]
<@3>Professor, have you noticed that
this door is a different colour than
all the others in the area?<W>
!------------------------------!
And look at these vines. Have you
seen vines growing on any other
house in St Mystere?<W>
!------------------------------!
This nameplate on the door says
"House of Puzzles".
!******************************!
[e275_t1.txt]
Indeed.<W> I'm not quite sure what else
lies behind the door, but it's clear
there are puzzles hiding inside.<W>
!------------------------------!
Sadly, the door is shut tight, and
there's no sense in waiting around
for it to open. Let's return later.

yourself hopelessly, achingly,
painfully stuck on puzzles?<W>

Well then, sonny, you've come to the
right place! Welcome to Granny
Riddleton's Puzzle Shack!
!******************************!
[e276_t1.txt]
<@3>Granny Riddleton?<W> Where can we
find this lady?
!******************************!
[e276_t2.txt]
Isn't it obvious? She's right in
front of you, boy!<W>&SetAni 2 finger& Tsk, no wonder
you have trouble solving puzzles!<W>
!------------------------------!
Yes, you are gazing at the beautiful
and clairvoyant Granny Riddleton,
guide to the puzzled puzzlers!
!******************************!
[e276_t3.txt]
<@3>Beautiful and clairvoyant?<W>
!------------------------------!
Professor, do you know what
she's going on about?
!******************************!
[e276_t4.txt]
Fret not, Luke. Why don't you let me
do the talking here.<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 0 talk_hands&Sorry to disturb you, Ms. Riddleton,
but by clairvoyant, do you mean to
say that you have psychic powers?<W>
!------------------------------!
Can you do things like, say, pick a
criminal out of a crowd or visualise
the location of lost objects?
!******************************!
[e276_t5.txt]
Pshaw! Any fortune-teller can do
that. So what if you can see a few
days into the future?<W> Big whoop!<W>
!------------------------------!
My speciality, you see, is puzzles!<W>
Puzzles people forget about!<W>
Puzzles people miss!<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 2 finger&Surely you boys've had a few of
those, eh?<W> No need to turn red.
It happens to the best of puzzlers.<W>
!------------------------------!
What I do, you see, is I take those
poor, lost little puzzles and invite
them to come stay with me.
!******************************!
[e276_t6.txt]
<@3>Wow! So the puzzles that we
have forgotten about...
Those puzzles are here now?
!******************************!
[e276_t7.txt]
Not quite, boy. I'm here to welcome
puzzles that have no other place to
stay in this village.<W>
!------------------------------!
Ehee hee! It looks like you've finally
worked out what makes me so
amazing, boy.<W>
!------------------------------!
Now go ahead and give a knock on
the door of that little shack
behind me.<W>
!------------------------------!
Inside you'll find rows of cute little
jars, each one of them with
a forgotten puzzle stuffed inside.<W>
!------------------------------!
I bet you can find those forgotten
puzzles of yours somewhere in the
midst of all my little pretties.
!******************************!
[e276_t8.txt]
If the cottage is empty, then you'll
just have to get out there and find
some more puzzles!<W>
!------------------------------!
On the other hand, if you leave too
many puzzles unsolved, they might
not all fit in the cottage!<W>
!------------------------------!
If that's the case, you can see the
rest of your lost puzzles by tapping
on the broom icon that will appear.<W>
!------------------------------!
Now go on, see what you have
waiting inside the cottage.
!******************************!
[e277_t0.txt]
You fellows seem like you're out
searching for something.<W> It's clear
as day to me.
!******************************!
[e277_t1.txt]
Perhaps you could help us.<W> Do you
know of anyone who the baron might
have considered a close friend?
!******************************!
[e277_t2.txt]
Someone chummy with the baron, eh?<W>
I did see him with the mustachioed
man in the market quite often.<W>
!------------------------------!
His name escapes me right now, but
you know the one. You should go
check the market for clues.
!******************************!
[e277_t3.txt]
Very good, we'll do just that.
Much obliged.
!******************************!
[e278_t0.txt]
Hey there, gents! Looking for
something, are you?
!******************************!
[e278_t1.txt]
<@3>We were called to St Mystere to
locate the Golden Apple.<W> We came
all the way from London!<W>
!------------------------------!
But we keep getting sidetracked by
unrelated matters! We haven't made
any progress in our investigation!
!******************************!
[e278_t2.txt]
Sorry to hear things aren't going
smoothly.<W> Well, you like puzzles, don't
you? You'll fit right in here!
!******************************!
[e278_t3.txt]
I'm breaking a sweat here trying to
keep things together! Would you
mind helping me out with a problem?<W>
!------------------------------!
I have some milk I need to divvy up,
but my measuring cup seems to
have grown legs and walked away.<W>
!------------------------------!
Do you have any ideas how I might
get myself out of this little pickle?
!******************************!
[e278_t4.txt]
Back to think on my problem again?<W>
That's awfully nice of you.
!******************************!
[e278_t5.txt]
Are you looking for Franco's bridge
crank? I heard it went missing.<W> He's
been sulking quite a bit.<W>
!------------------------------!
Franco is a thick-skinned guy, but
that bridge is his life. I've never
seen him so down in the dumps.
!******************************!
[e278_t6.txt]
Thanks! Now I can finally start on
those scones!<W> There must be
some way I can return the favour.<W>
!------------------------------!
Well, this being a restaurant and
all, come by and eat whenever you
like. It's on the house!
!******************************!
[e278_t7.txt]
Hmm, I guess it really is impossible.
Maybe I should just give up and
buy a new measuring cup.
!******************************!
[e279_t0.txt]
I have work to do now.<W> For that
matter, so do you!<W><@C>
&SetAni 0 point&Shouldn't you two get climbing?
The top of the tower's a long
way up!
!******************************!
[e279_t1.txt]
Go on, off with you now!
!******************************!
[e288_t0.txt]
I am a man who likes his templates
and forms, and you are a man who
likes stamps, yes?<W> I thought so.<W>
!------------------------------!
I have just the puzzle for a man like
yourself then.<W>
!------------------------------!
I strongly advise you make yourself
useful and solve this puzzle without
bothering me about it.
!******************************!
[e288_t1.txt]
I know what you want. You want to
solve that stamp puzzle, yes?<W> I knew
you were a stamp fanatic!
!******************************!
[e288_t2.txt]
The life of a bureaucrat is
extremely busy.<W>
!------------------------------!
Unless you have an issue to address
AND the proper forms, I strongly
advise that both of you leave.
!******************************!
[e288_t3.txt]
I knew a stamp aficionado like you
could handle this. Now I can finally
post those documents.<W>
!------------------------------!
I strongly advise that you vacate
the office and let me return to
my business.
!******************************!
[e288_t4.txt]
If you can't solve this puzzle, I
strongly advise that you get out.
I'm busy, and I need space to work.
!******************************!
[e290_t0.txt]
A letter requesting help brings
Professor Layton and his assistant
Luke to the remote St Mystere.
!******************************!
[e290_t1.txt]
After solving a puzzle, the pair are
able to cross the drawbridge that
leads into the village.<W>
!------------------------------!
Now Luke and Layton must go to
Reinhold Manor, residence of Lady
Dahlia, the author of the letter.
!******************************!
[e291_t0.txt]
The professor and Luke make their
way successfully to Reinhold Manor,
where they meet Lady Dahlia.
!******************************!
[e291_t1.txt]
But before they can start talking,
a loud noise startles Lady Dahlia's
cat, Claudia, who runs off.<W>
!------------------------------!
The professor and Luke are now
forced to find the missing feline.
!******************************!
[e292_t0.txt]
Having finally returned to Reinhold
Manor with Claudia in tow,<W>
!------------------------------!
Layton and Luke are horrified to
discover that a murder has taken
place there during their absence.
!******************************!
[e292_t1.txt]
Waiting for Luke and Layton at
the manor is police detective
Inspector Chelmey.<W>
!------------------------------!
Upon receiving a report of a
murder, he has raced to St Mystere
to conduct an investigation.<W>
!------------------------------!
He has his suspicions about Luke
and Layton.<W>
!------------------------------!
Shortly after the murder, a
servant to the Reinhold family
named Ramon goes missing.<W>
!------------------------------!
At Lady Dahlia's request, Luke and
the professor set out to gather
information on his whereabouts.
!******************************!
[e293_t0.txt]
In the course of their afternoon-
long investigation through
St Mystere,<W>
!------------------------------!
Luke and Layton hear a rumour
about some mysterious kidnappings.
!******************************!
[e293_t1.txt]
The professor has a hunch that
Ramon's disappearance and these
kidnappings must be connected.<W>
!------------------------------!
In a quest for further details, the
intrepid pair continue their search
of St Mystere into the night.
!******************************!
[e294_t0.txt]
After witnessing Ramon's abduction
before their very eyes,<W>
!------------------------------!
Luke and Professor Layton are
shocked to see him return to
Reinhold Manor on his own.
!******************************!
[e294_t1.txt]
Busy with the murder investigation,
Inspector Chelmey warns Layton
against meddling any further.<W>
!------------------------------!
However, Layton is confident that
the Golden Apple and the morning's
murder are linked to one another.<W>
!------------------------------!
Finally free to move about, Layton
and Luke begin their search for the
Golden Apple in earnest.
!******************************!
[e295_t0.txt]
The professor and Luke continue
their investigation around
St Mystere for the Golden Apple.<W>
!------------------------------!
Conversations with the baron's
associates lead the pair to the
grave of the baron's former wife.
!******************************!
[e295_t1.txt]
In addition, the two recover a
part of Baron Reinhold's
personal diary.<W>
!------------------------------!
Regardless of this, Luke and Layton
are no closer to understanding
just what the Golden Apple is.
!******************************!
[e295_t2.txt]
The menacing tower at the edge
of St Mystere has roused the
professor's suspicions.<W>
!------------------------------!
Eager to investigate further, Luke
and Layton head in its direction.
!******************************!
[e296_t0.txt]
Luke and Layton meet a mysterious
young girl at the dead end on the
north side of the village.<W>
!------------------------------!
She starts to tell them something,
but a sinister figure lurking in the
shadows scares her off.
!******************************!
[e296_t1.txt]
Afterwards, a puzzled Layton and
Luke find a ticket for a Ferris
wheel, and head towards it.
!******************************!
[e297_t0.txt]
Layton and Luke narrowly escape
being crushed by a runaway Ferris
wheel while searching the park.<W>
!------------------------------!
The Ferris wheel destroys an old
shack on the shore, revealing
a secret subterranean path.
!******************************!
[e297_t1.txt]
After finding a tower-shaped key in
the underground room, Layton and
Luke make their way to the village.
!******************************!
[e297_t2.txt]
With the key in hand, Layton debates
heading to the tower.<W>
!------------------------------!
However, after sensing a sinister
presence near them, the professor
devises a plan to out the fiend.
!******************************!
[e298_t0.txt]
Layton exposes Don Paolo, the evil
scientist who was posing as
Inspector Chelmey.
!******************************!
[e298_t1.txt]
His disguise now gone, Don Paolo
escapes from the manor, leaving
only his latex mask behind.
!******************************!
[e298_t2.txt]
Having outed the fiend who tried to
take their lives, Luke and Layton
set out to explore the tower.
!******************************!
[e299_t0.txt]
After a long search, Luke and
Professor Layton finally gain
access to the tower.
!******************************!
[e299_t1.txt]
Inside, they learn the truth behind
the village of St Mystere and
Ramon's abduction.
!******************************!
[e299_t2.txt]
Still reeling from the strange turn
of events, the two climb the tower
in search of the Golden Apple.
!******************************!
[e299_t3.txt]
Will the daring pair finally find the
treasure they seek at the top of
the tower?
!******************************!
[e311_t0.txt]
<@1>Oh, this time I've REALLY had it!<W>
I thought up this GREAT puzzle, but I
couldn't find ANYONE to tell it to!
!******************************!
[e311_t1.txt]
<@1>Oh, so NOW you want to get all
serious about solving my puzzle!
That makes sense!
!******************************!
[e311_t2.txt]
<@1>Whew... Rage sure works up an
appetite. I'm starving.
!******************************!
[e311_t3.txt]
<@1>Oh, COME ON!<W> I was all ready to tell
you the answer and everything!<W>
!------------------------------!
But NOOOOO, you had to go and ruin
it by answering before I said it was
OK, didn't you?!<W> DIDN'T YOU?!<W>
!------------------------------!
Have you ever considered the
strong possibility that you might
be a real pain in the neck?
!******************************!
[e311_t4.txt]
<@1>WHAT?!<W> Now you're just messing with
me, aren't you!
!******************************!
[e312_t0.txt]
You two are certainly crazy about
puzzles, aren't you!<W> Well, I've got a
whopper of a puzzle for you!
!******************************!
[e312_t1.txt]
That's the spirit! When life knocks
you down, get up and try again! You
youngsters are full of beans!
!******************************!
[e312_t2.txt]
Sorry, laddie, I don't have any more
puzzles for you right now. 
!******************************!
[e312_t3.txt]
What cunning lads you two are!<W> I
hope you'll stop by and solve puzzles
with me again sometime.
!******************************!
[e312_t4.txt]
Are you saying you don't have time
to solve puzzles with an old crone
like me?<W>
!------------------------------!
You youngsters can be awfully
cold sometimes.
!******************************!
[e313_t0.txt]
<@1>So sorry to bother you while you're
busy, but you'd make an old man very
happy by helping with this puzzle.
!******************************!
[e313_t1.txt]
Certainly. Let's have a look.
!******************************!
[e313_t2.txt]
<@1>Oh, let me guess. You thought up
the answer while you were away?
!******************************!
[e313_t3.txt]
<@1>Hello, again. Are you here to take
another look at my desk?
!******************************!
[e313_t4.txt]
<@1>Ah, I see.<W> In my heyday, I could've
solved a puzzle like that before
you could say "cobblestone".<W>
!------------------------------!
My goodness, I guess I'm getting
soft in my old age...
!******************************!
[e313_t5.txt]
<@1>Come back anytime you like. I'm
always happy to have company over.
!******************************!
[e314_t0.txt]
<@3>There's a great view of the
entrance to the village from here.
!******************************!
[e314_t1.txt]
There's the Laytonmobile.
It seems unharmed.
!******************************!
[e314_t2.txt]
<@3>Don't worry, Professor. No one
would even dream of stealing
the Laytonmobile.
!******************************!
[e314_t3.txt]
...<W>Just what do you mean by
that, Luke?
!******************************!
[e315_t0.txt]
Come now, my boy. Think carefully...
!******************************!
[e315_t1.txt]
<@3>...<W>&SetAni 1 smile&Oh yes, now I remember!
!******************************!
[e316_t0.txt]
<@3>I remember now! It's right here!
!******************************!
[e316_t1.txt]
<@3>Aha!<W> A hidden switch!
!******************************!
[e316_t2.txt]
The switch seems to have activated
the wall!
!******************************!
[e316_t3.txt]
<@3>And to think that Reinhold Manor
held the secret behind this painting
all along...<W>
!------------------------------!
It looks like there's a passage that
leads further in.
!******************************!
[e316_t4.txt]
<@3>Oh...
!******************************!
[e316_t5.txt]
Let's see where this passage goes.
!******************************!
[e317_t0.txt]
<@3>I'm simply shocked-SHOCKED!-at
this turn of events!<W>
!------------------------------!
Who could have guessed that we
had an impostor in our midst? He
had me completely fooled.
!******************************!
[e317_t1.txt]
<@3>But you saw right through him,
Professor. I must say, I'm quite
impressed with your cunning.
!******************************!
[e317_t10.txt]
<@3>Now why would I have a silly dream
like that? These past few days
have really been quite draining.
!******************************!
[e317_t11.txt]
<@3>Hm...
!******************************!
[e317_t12.txt]
<@3>Professor Layton, I-I don't feel
particularly well at the moment. I
think I'll go and lie down for a bit.
!******************************!
[e317_t13.txt]
<@3>What's wrong with Lady Dahlia?
!******************************!
[e317_t14.txt]
She had a dream of walking in
the park with her young daughter.
!******************************!
[e317_t15.txt]
There's something quite curious
about that dream...
!******************************!
[e317_t2.txt]
<@3>I ask you now to put that brilliant
mind of yours to work again and set
out in search of the Golden Apple.
!******************************!
[e317_t3.txt]
It would be my pleasure, Madam.
!******************************!
[e317_t4.txt]
By the way, are you feeling all
right? You look a bit pale.
!******************************!
[e317_t5.txt]
<@3>Mm...
!******************************!
[e317_t6.txt]
<@3>I awoke this morning with memories
of a peculiar dream I must have had
last night.
!******************************!
[e317_t7.txt]
<@3>In it, my husband and I had just had
a brand-new baby girl, and oh, how
everyone fawned over her.
!******************************!
[e317_t8.txt]
<@3>The next moment, suddenly I was in a
park walking hand-in-hand with my
young daughter.
!******************************!
[e317_t9.txt]
With your daughter, you say?
!******************************!
[e318_t0.txt]
<@3>Professor, there's something on
the ground here.
!******************************!
[e318_t1.txt]
You're right... It appears to be a
scrap of paper.<W> Will you check if
anything's written on it?
!******************************!
[e318_t2.txt]
<@3>Sure thing!<W> Let's see here...
!******************************!
[e318_t3.txt]
#rThe boss complimented my latest
model today.<W>
!------------------------------!
He's a good guy, and he's given me a
new sense of purpose. I'm sure this
is my true calling.<W>
!------------------------------!
I want to perfect my skills so
I can repay the man for his
generosity.#x
!******************************!
[e318_t4.txt]
This sounds a great deal like a
diary entry, doesn't it?<W>
!------------------------------!
Judging by how the writer uses the
term "the boss", I imagine he was
under the employ of the baron.
!******************************!
[e318_t5.txt]
#rI've constructed models to fit
every situation, just like the boss
asked me to do.<W>
!------------------------------!
I have to smile when I see how
interested he is in them.#x
!******************************!
[e318_t6.txt]
<@3>That's the end of the entry. Do you
suppose this person made some sort
of models for a living?
!******************************!
[e318_t7.txt]
Hmm...
!******************************!
[e319_t0.txt]
<@3>What's that on the ground?
!******************************!
[e319_t1.txt]
It looks like a scrap of notepaper.<W>
What does it say, Luke?
!******************************!
[e319_t2.txt]
<@3>Well, let's see here. Ahem...
!******************************!
[e319_t3.txt]
#rIt's just terrible. Lady Viola has
an awful case of the flu and hasn't
left her bed for days.<W>
!------------------------------!
I'm no doctor, so I can't think of
any way to help her... Oh, what
to do... What to do...#x
!******************************!
[e319_t4.txt]
<@3>Lady Viola... Oh, this entry must
be talking about Baron Reinhold's
first wife.
!******************************!
[e319_t5.txt]
#rMy heart is heavy as I write
these words.<W><@C>
The loss of his wife has completely
crushed the boss. If only there was
something I could do to help...<W>
!------------------------------!
He walks around looking like he's
had the wind knocked out of him...#x
!******************************!
[e319_t6.txt]
<@3>And that's the end.<W>
!------------------------------!
Gosh, whoever wrote this must have
cared an awful lot for the baron
and his family.
!******************************!
[e319_t7.txt]
Hm...
!******************************!
[e320_t0.txt]
<@3>Oh, what's that on the ground?
!******************************!
[e320_t1.txt]
It appears to be a scrap of paper.<W>
Can you please read what's written
on it, Luke?
!******************************!
[e320_t2.txt]
<@3>Leave it to me, Professor.<W> Hmm...
!******************************!
[e320_t3.txt]
#rThe boss hasn't been himself since
Lady Viola's passing, and he shows
no signs of recovering.<W>
!------------------------------!
That's why I've decided I'll make one
as a tribute to Lady Viola. I'm sure
it will put a smile back on his face.#x
!******************************!
[e320_t4.txt]
Ah yes, now it makes sense. Could
our mystery author be...him?
!******************************!
[e320_t5.txt]
#rI've worked my fingers to the bone
trying to cheer up the boss.<W>
!------------------------------!
Looking out over St Mystere, I see
a thriving, bustling village.<W>
!------------------------------!
With so many villagers to keep
him company, maybe he can
finally be happy again.#x
!******************************!
[e320_t6.txt]
<@3>That's the end of the page.<W>
!------------------------------!
Professor, what's the matter? You
look deep in thought.
!******************************!
[e320_t7.txt]
I can't confirm my suspicions at the
moment. But I think it's safe to say
this goes deeper than we thought.
!******************************!
[e321_t0.txt]
<@3>Look at this, Professor. It was
lying on the ground.
!******************************!
[e321_t1.txt]
It appears to be a scrap of
notepaper.<W> Would you read it
aloud for me?
!******************************!
[e321_t2.txt]
<@3>No problem, Professor.<W> All right,
let's see...
!******************************!
[e321_t3.txt]
#rThe older she gets, the more
Young Miss is catching on to this
village's secret.<W>
!------------------------------!
She seems lonely, which is probably
why the boss asked me to build an
amusement park for her.<W>
!------------------------------!
Yep, it certainly looks like I've got
my work cut out for me.#x
!******************************!
[e321_t4.txt]
<@3>The "Young Miss" mentioned here
must be Flora. The whole park was
built just for her!<W>
!------------------------------!
But I don't understand this other
line. What's all this business
about a secret in the village?
!******************************!
[e321_t5.txt]
#rI just wasn't ready to handle the
boss's death. Poor Young Miss. She's
all alone in the world now.<W>
!------------------------------!
But no matter what happens, I have
to keep going and take care of her
in the boss's place.#x
!******************************!
[e321_t6.txt]
<@3>The page ends there.
!******************************!
[e321_t7.txt]
Baron Reinhold sounds like he truly
loved his daughter more than
anything.<W> Fate can be so cruel.
!******************************!
[e322_t0.txt]
<@3>We seem to have stumbled on a
hidden puzzle here, Professor!
!******************************!
[e322_t1.txt]
<@3>Oh, look! It's that hidden puzzle
from before.
!******************************!
[e322_t2.txt]

!******************************!
[e324_t8.txt]
Oh? I was under the impression that

going near the tower.

more puzzles!
!******************************!
[e338_t3.txt]
<@3>This puzzle hurts my head...
!******************************!
[e339_t0.txt]
Inspector Chelmey and my lady have
already retired for the night.<W>
Ramon is likely off to the cafe.<W>
!------------------------------!
You've had a very hard day,
Professor. Do try and get some
rest. Good night, sir.
!******************************!
[e342_t0.txt]
Though you've reached the story's
end, "Professor Layton and the
Curious Village" is far from over.<W>
!------------------------------!
How many puzzles did you solve over
the course of your adventure?<W>
!------------------------------!
Precisely 120 puzzles are hidden
throughout the village, so why not
try to complete every puzzle?<W>
!------------------------------!
Also, be sure to check the Bonuses
section. Fulfil certain conditions
to unlock more bonus content.<W>
!------------------------------!
Your game will save now.<W> When
you continue, you will resume play
at the top of the tower.
!******************************!
[e344_t0.txt]
Are you becoming accustomed to
moving around and investigating
St Mystere?<W>
!------------------------------!
Here's some advice to keep your
investigation running smoothly.<W>
!------------------------------!
Some puzzles will disappear from
their location in the village
as the story progresses.
!******************************!
[e344_t1.txt]
But there's no need to worry!<W>
!------------------------------!
Most of the unsolved puzzles are
sent to Granny Riddleton's shack
in the village square.<W>
!------------------------------!
Visit often to track down puzzles
you passed up and work towards
completing every puzzle in the game!
!******************************!
[e345_t0.txt]
I suppose congratulations are in
order. You've made it this far,
after all.<W>
!------------------------------!
Of course, it looks like you've left
quite a few of my puzzles in
the village untouched.
!******************************!
[e345_t1.txt]
<@3>Wh-what was that? Where's that
voice coming from?!
!******************************!
[e345_t2.txt]
I've hidden all sorts of wonderful
puzzles across St Mystere.<W>
!------------------------------!
Go back to the village, traveller,
and test your mettle against a few
more of my puzzles.
!******************************!
[e345_t3.txt]
I'm not so unreasonable that I'd
make you solve every single puzzle
before passing through here.<W>
!------------------------------!
But you're sorely mistaken if you
think I'll let you through with less
than 75 puzzles to your name.<W>
!------------------------------!
Come back when you've got
the goods.
!******************************!
[e345_t4.txt]
<@3>Who do you suppose that was?
!******************************!
[e345_t5.txt]
Hmm... &SetAni 0 Think&I can't quite place it.<W>
Regardless, it seems that mystery
will have to wait.<W>
!------------------------------!
If we don't solve 75 puzzles first,
we'll never make it inside the tower.
Let's go back to the village.
!******************************!
[e345_t6.txt]
Hmm...<W> Well, it looks like you've
solved at least 75 puzzles.<W>
!------------------------------!
All right then, go on in the tower.
