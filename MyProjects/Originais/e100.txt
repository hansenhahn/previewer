We shall respect the inspector's
wishes and leave the murder case
alone, Luke.<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 0 talk_hands&It's as Inspector Chelmey said.
Solving crime is the police's job.<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 0 smile&Besides, something tells me that
this case and the Golden Apple are
more related than we realise.
!******************************!
[e100_t1.txt]
<@3>That's that intuition of yours
talking again, isn't it, Professor?
!******************************!
[e100_t2.txt]
<@3>So, what's our next move?
!******************************!
[e100_t3.txt]
First and foremost, we need to find
a clue that will bring us closer to
the Golden Apple.<W>
!------------------------------!
Perhaps one of Baron Reinhold's
relations or close friends can help
point us in the right direction.<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 0 smile&Of course, there's also someone
else...<W> Let's see if the butler has
anything to say on the subject.
!******************************!
[e101_t0.txt]
<@3>Oh, look who it is! Professor Ladle,
was it?
!******************************!
[e101_t1.txt]
The name's Layton, madam.
!******************************!
[e101_t2.txt]
<@3>Oh, that's right, Professor Layton.<W>
!------------------------------!
All that talking about the mansion
we did last time got me reminiscing,
so I decided to stop by for a visit.<W>
!------------------------------!
But enough about me! By the look on
your face, it seems that you have
something you want to ask me.
!******************************!
[e101_t3.txt]
As a matter of fact, I do. Do you
happen to know who #rBaron Reinhold
considered his close friends#x?
!******************************!
[e101_t4.txt]
<@3>&SetAni 2 pachi&His friends, you say...<W> Well...<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 2 talk&He wasn't exactly what you'd
call a social butterfly.<W> I'm sorry,
that's all I can remember.<W>
!------------------------------!
Oh, wait a moment.<W> I do believe I
saw that Zappone fellow pay a visit
to the mansion a few times.&SetAni 2 pachi&
!******************************!
[e101_t5.txt]
<@3>Professor, could she be referring
to that man we met?
!******************************!
[e101_t6.txt]
Ah, yes, that gentleman with the
fancy little moustache!<W> We should
ask if he knows anything.<W>
!------------------------------!
I would wager he's still hanging
around that fork in the road just
beyond the clock tower.
!******************************!
[e102_t0.txt]
<@3>This park has been closed every
time we've come by. Why do you
suppose that is, Professor?
!******************************!
[e102_t1.txt]
Hmm. I haven't the foggiest idea.
Perhaps we should ask someone
at the village hall.
!******************************!
[e102_t2.txt]
<@3>Huh, it's still locked shut.<W> Just when
will this place open?
!******************************!
[e102_t3.txt]
I wouldn't get your hopes up. The
gate's covered in dust.<W> I don't think
anyone's been here for a long time.
!******************************!
[e102_t4.txt]
We need to find someone 
to open this gate.
!******************************!
[e103_t0.txt]
Not being a member of high society
myself, I've never so much as had a
conversation with Baron Reinhold.<W>
!------------------------------!
Now, laddie, much as I'd like to keep
chatting, I'm awfully tired. I think I
need to go and lie down.
!******************************!
[e103_t1.txt]
Are you feeling unwell, sir?
!******************************!
[e103_t2.txt]
I'm just exhausted lately. It's that
awful noise coming from the tower,
you see.<W>
!------------------------------!
It's got so loud I can't sleep a
wink at night.
!******************************!
[e103_t3.txt]
Do you know what's causing
the noise?
!******************************!
[e103_t4.txt]
It's just a rumour, but I hear that
every time that sound rips through
St Mystere, someone disappears.<W>
!------------------------------!
They say the ones who go
missing are people who've been
talking about feeling tired.
!******************************!
[e103_t5.txt]
But those who disappear are back
before you know it, so it's
probably just a load of poppycock.
!******************************!
[e103_t6.txt]
Whenever the noise occurs, someone
disappears... Interesting.
!******************************!
[e103_t7.txt]
<@3>Do you think the peculiar sound has
anything to do with that strange
old man who kidnapped Ramon?
!******************************!
[e103_t8.txt]
It's certainly a possibility, isn't it?<W>
!------------------------------!
But why would he release his victims
after going through the trouble of
kidnapping them?
!******************************!
[e103_t9.txt]
If you're looking for Zappone, you
can probably find him loafing around
by the fork in the road.
!******************************!
[e104_t0.txt]
Luke, we must head to the manor
now. We mustn't keep Inspector
Chelmey waiting.
!******************************!
[e104_t1.txt]
<@3>You're right, Professor.<W> But I do
wish we didn't have to talk to that
grumpy old man again.

What's that you say? The gate to

!******************************!
[e105_t1.txt]
No, no, no, that's impossible. We've
employed a caretaker who should
have everything up and running.
!******************************!
[e105_t10.txt]
<@3>Oh, right, the one on the path to
the park.<W> Well, it's a dirty job, but
someone has to do it.
!******************************!
[e105_t11.txt]
Off we go!
!******************************!
[e105_t2.txt]
Be that as it may, the gate is
locked shut, and we can't gain
entrance to the place...<W>
!------------------------------!
Would you please open it for us?
!******************************!
[e105_t3.txt]
That sort of thing is the job of
the park caretaker. I strongly
advise you to go and find him.
!******************************!
[e105_t4.txt]
Well, where do you think we might
find this caretaker?
!******************************!
[e105_t5.txt]
Hmm. Now that's a good question,
isn't it?<W> Managing the park is the
caretaker's duty...<W>
!------------------------------!
But who knows who manages the
caretaker?<W> I can't say. It's not
one of my duties.
!******************************!
[e105_t6.txt]
<@3>&SetAni 1 shout&What bureaucracy!
!******************************!
[e105_t7.txt]
He manages the village sewer
systems as well.<W>
!------------------------------!
Now unless you have some form
you need to fill in, I strongly
advise you to get out.
!******************************!
[e105_t8.txt]
<@3>Gosh, he's rude.
!******************************!
[e105_t9.txt]
The sewers? Unpleasant as it might
be, it is one place we haven't
searched yet.<W>
!------------------------------!
Perhaps we will find a clue to our
mystery down there. I've only seen
one manhole in the village.
!******************************!
[e106_t0.txt]
Hello, there! Now what can I do for
you fellows?
!******************************!
[e106_t1.txt]
You're the park caretaker, are
you not? Would you mind opening
up the gate to the park for us?
!******************************!
[e106_t10.txt]
Is there anything we can do to
help, then?
!******************************!
[e106_t11.txt]
Funny you should mention that. If
I could just work out the area on
this map, I'd be done in a jiffy.<W>
!------------------------------!
You any good with things like that?
!******************************!
[e106_t12.txt]
You lads must really want into me
park.<W> Well, solve this puzzle and
I'll get you in.
!******************************!

Fine work, the both of you! Soon
as I take care of this little
puzzle, I'll open that gate for you.

There! That should take care of
this mess!<W> Now let's open up the
park, eh?
!******************************!

Just hold on one second here...

[e106_t16.txt]
Hard, isn't it? I can't make heads or
tails of it meself. Sorry, it looks
like the park will have to wait. 
!******************************!
[e106_t2.txt]
You want to go to the park?
Well, you lads are certainly
curious.
!******************************!
[e106_t3.txt]

to explore now.

!******************************!
[e106_t5.txt]
Thank you. You've been a great
help, sir.
!******************************!
[e106_t6.txt]
Ha ha ha! I hardly need thanking,
sir. After all, this is me job.
!******************************!
[e106_t7.txt]
Way back when, I used to keep it
open every day, but these villagers,
they don't care at all for me park.

I'm glad you fellows stopped by. It's
the first time in a while I've had to
do me job.

a murder at Reinhold Manor?

[e109_t1.txt]
A murder in our little village! The
very thought gives me the shivers.
And a great idea for a novel!
!******************************!
[e109_t10.txt]
<@3>There's something really scary
about that tower...
!******************************!
[e109_t2.txt]
Oh, excuse my insensitivity. I'm just
always on the lookout for new
ideas. How can I help you?
!******************************!
[e109_t3.txt]
<@3>We're looking for Ramon. Have you
seen him around?
!******************************!
[e109_t4.txt]
Hmm, no, I can't say that I've seen
him today.
!******************************!
[e109_t5.txt]
But if your search has
turned up nothing, he's probably at
the park, or in the tower...<W>
!------------------------------!
You know, somewhere the villagers
don't normally go.
!******************************!
[e109_t6.txt]
<@3>The tower, huh...
!******************************!
[e109_t7.txt]
Oh, you should stay as far from
that tower as possible. There are
all sorts of bad rumours about it.
!******************************!
[e109_t8.txt]
<@3>It does seem that way. We keep
running into people who say that.<W>
Just what are the rumours?
!******************************!
[e109_t9.txt]
Just, you know, bad stuff...
!******************************!
[e110_t0.txt]
I hear you've been investigating St
Mystere. Feel free to continue, but
stay away from that tower.<W>
!------------------------------!
That place brings misfortune upon
the village, and I strongly advise
you to keep your distance.
!******************************!
[e111_t0.txt]
<@3>What kind of lout just throws
rubbish on the ground?<W> I'm going to
pick it up.

that. How very curious...
!******************************!
[e112_t0.txt]
<@1>So, is it true what I'm hearing about
the two of you?<W>
!------------------------------!
Are you really searching the village
for the Reinhold fortune?
!******************************!
[e112_t1.txt]
That's correct, sir. Currently we're
in search of a close friend of
Baron Reinhold's.<W>
!------------------------------!
We believe he has entrusted this
friend with an important note.
!******************************!
[e112_t10.txt]
Understood.
!******************************!
[e112_t11.txt]
<@1>Hrmm, not there yet.<W> I can't let you
examine that desk until you have
50 puzzles to your name.
!******************************!
[e112_t12.txt]
<@1>I'm sure Gus wouldn't mind two fine
puzzle lovers such as yourselves
looking over his desk.<W>
!------------------------------!
Hrmm...<W> Actually, let me impart a few
pearls of wisdom on you while I've
got your attention.<W>
!------------------------------!
Focusing on your case is all well and
good, but if you don't solve some
puzzles, you'll be sorry later.<W>
!------------------------------!
So make an effort to find puzzles
around the village and just
solve the ones you can.<W>
!------------------------------!
Take it from this old-timer. It's
good to stop and smell the puzzles
sometimes.
!******************************!
[e112_t13.txt]
<@1>All right, I'll get off my high horse
now. Let's head on over to my house.

<@1>This is Gus's old desk. Take all the
time you need to examine it.

Splendid. Luke, let's get right to it.
!******************************!
[e112_t2.txt]
<@1>Gracious, that's quite a search you
have on your hands. <W>
!------------------------------!
Oh, excuse me. My name is Archibald.
Gus- I mean, the baron and I were
great friends. Thick as thieves!<W>
!------------------------------!
We used to have the most amazing
conversations late into the night...<W>
!------------------------------!
Do you think that perhaps I am the
one you're searching for?
!******************************!
[e112_t3.txt]
Yes, I think so! What luck that
after all this searching, we should
bump into you in a place like this.<W>
!------------------------------!
I have one question.<W> Do you recall
ever receiving a small note or
written message from the baron?
!******************************!
[e112_t4.txt]
<@1>Hrmm... No, I don't remember ever
receiving anything of the sort
from Gus.
!******************************!
[e112_t5.txt]
<@1>But he did give me a fine desk that
once belonged to him. It's at home.
Maybe it holds some kind of clue.
!******************************!
[e112_t6.txt]
The baron's desk, you say?
Excellent!
!******************************!
[e112_t7.txt]
<@1>Would you like to come over to my
house and take a look at it?
!******************************!
[e112_t8.txt]
You are most gracious. If you'd be
kind enough to allow us a look at it,
we would be very grateful.
!******************************!
[e112_t9.txt]
<@1>It's fine with me.<W> Just one thing,
though. You see, Gus and I both
loved puzzles.<W>
!------------------------------!
It just wouldn't be right to let two
strangers who haven't even solved
50 puzzles examine his belongings.<W>
!------------------------------!
When you have 50 puzzles to your
name, come and pay this old man
another visit, all right?<W>
!------------------------------!
The number of puzzles you have
solved is indicated by that number
above your map of the village.<W>
!------------------------------!
If you two can manage to solve 50
puzzles, I'll happily take you to
see Gus's desk.

[e121_t1.txt]
<@3>Professor, what's this?
!******************************!
[e121_t2.txt]
<@3>A Ferris wheel ticket?
!******************************!
[e121_t3.txt]
Very curious indeed...<W> Luke, that
girl may have dropped this to tell
us where we should head next.
!******************************!
[e121_t4.txt]
<@3>But...but why would she want to
help us?
!******************************!
[e121_t5.txt]
Your guess is as good as mine, Luke.
Still, I can't help but feel that
she's trying to help us.
!******************************!
[e121_t6.txt]
<@3>Well, your intuition hasn't ever been
wrong. Let's see what we can find
around the park's Ferris wheel!
!******************************!
[e121_t7.txt]
<@1>Nyeh heh heh! That's right, Layton,
go straight to the park!<W>
!------------------------------!
You've been a thorn in my side for
too long. I think it's about time for
you to disappear...<W>for good.
!******************************!
[e121_t8.txt]
<@3>...Huh?
!******************************!
[e122_t0.txt]
#rClose friends of the baron#x?<W> Well,
I myself had the pleasure of meeting
Baron Reinhold a few times...
!******************************!
[e122_t1.txt]
<@3>But you weren't a close friend
of his?
!******************************!
[e122_t10.txt]
<@3>I guess Zappone can't really tell us
much of anything.
!******************************!
[e122_t11.txt]
Yes, I'm afraid he was no help at all.<W>
I suppose that means we're back
where we started.<W>
!------------------------------!
But at least we can be sure that
this close friend we're after is a
resident of St Mystere.<W>
!------------------------------!
We mustn't give up, Luke. Let's
continue to ask around.
!******************************!
[e122_t2.txt]
Me? <W> Ha ha ha! Oh, no, I was nothing
of the sort.
!******************************!
[e122_t3.txt]
I see... Can you think of anyone at
all who was friendly with Baron
Reinhold?
!******************************!
[e122_t4.txt]

no, I don't...<W> Or do I? Hmm...<W>

it? It's all rusty and abandoned.

[e123_t1.txt]
It's just as Sylvain said. It seems
that no one's set foot in this
park for a dreadfully long time.
!******************************!
[e123_t2.txt]
Now, on to business. Let's give the
grounds around the Ferris wheel a
thorough once-over.<W>
!------------------------------!
I expect we'll find something of
interest there.
!******************************!
[e124_t0.txt]
<@3>Look, Professor, there's a strange
little shed here.
!******************************!
[e124_t1.txt]
Interesting. It seems this shed
pumps water to the sewer pipes.<W> I
feel this warrants a closer look.
!******************************!
[e124_t2.txt]
Hmm.
!******************************!
[e124_t3.txt]
It doesn't appear that the door will
open. Let's move on and explore the
rest of the park, Luke.
!******************************!
[e125_t0.txt]
<@3>This place is so run down, it looks
like it hasn't been touched in years.<W>
!------------------------------!
What a shame! I bet it used to be a
fun place. There's even a big top,
the kind you see at the circus.
!******************************!
[e125_t1.txt]
Yes, there is something quite sad
about it, isn't there?<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 0 talk&...How strange. This was clearly a
travelling carnival, so why was it
left to rot here in St Mystere?
!******************************!
[e125_t2.txt]
<@3>I bet the Ferris wheel is a mess
too.<@W>2 I suppose I won't get to use
that ride ticket we picked up.
!******************************!
[e125_t3.txt]
Well, we have better things to do
than ride that thing, don't we?<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 0 talk&Somewhere in this park hides a clue
to finding the Golden Apple. I'm sure
of it.
!******************************!
[e126_t0.txt]
This must be the Ferris wheel we
were looking for.<W>
!------------------------------!
Luke, why don't you look around and
see if anything seems odd about it.
!******************************!
[e126_t1.txt]
<@3>Will do, Professor!
!******************************!
[e126_t10.txt]
I suppose my intuition failed us this
time, Luke.<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 0 talk_hands&Come, let's head back to the heart
of St Mystere and search for our
next lead.
!******************************!
[e126_t2.txt]
Hmm.
!******************************!
[e126_t3.txt]
<@3>Hmm.
!******************************!
[e126_t4.txt]
Did you find anything out of the
ordinary, Luke?
!******************************!
[e126_t5.txt]
<@3>No, not a thing. Maybe there's no
secret hidden in this Ferris wheel
after all.

[e128_t8.txt]
Now, what's an entrance to the
sewers doing here?
!******************************!
[e128_t9.txt]
This could well be an underground
passage to the tower. We've got to
take a look below. Come.
!******************************!
[e129_t0.txt]
<@3>Look, there's a sort of stone
tablet embedded in the wall!
!******************************!
[e129_t1.txt]
This is clearly some kind of puzzle.
I'd wager the solution will tell us
the direction in which to proceed.
!******************************!
[e129_t2.txt]
We can't proceed until we solve this
puzzle, Luke.
!******************************!
[e129_t3.txt]
With its secret revealed, we needn't
examine this tablet any further.<W>
!------------------------------!
Come, Luke. We must press on.
!******************************!
[e129_t4.txt]
There's our answer. We will proceed
down the left corridor.
!******************************!
[e129_t5.txt]
<@3>Understood, Professor!
!******************************!
[e129_t6.txt]
<@3>I'm embarrassed to admit that this
puzzle has me stumped.
!******************************!
[e129_t7.txt]
Not to worry, my boy. Take a moment
to collect your thoughts and then
try again.
!******************************!
[e130_t0.txt]
<@3>Something's hidden behind here.
!******************************!
[e130_t1.txt]
All right. Let's move the picture out
of the way then.
!******************************!
[e130_t2.txt]
<@3>What's this here?
!******************************!
[e130_t3.txt]
It appears to be some sort of key.
!******************************!
[e130_t4.txt]
<@3>But what does it unlock?
!******************************!
[e130_t5.txt]
We won't know until we investigate
further.<W> But this shape certainly
looks familiar...
!******************************!
[e130_t6.txt]
<@3>Professor, could this be...?
!******************************!
[e130_t7.txt]
It looks just like<@w>2.<@w>2.<@w>2.the tower.
!******************************!
[e130_t8.txt]
I knew there was something odd
about that dead end.<W> Perhaps this
key will shed some light on things.
!******************************!
[e130_t9.txt]
Luke, we need to head back to that
large wall on the north side of
St Mystere.<W>
!------------------------------!
I have a hunch that it's more than
just a dead end.
!******************************!
[e131_t0.txt]
<@3>Let's investigate that dead end
right away!
!******************************!
[e131_t1.txt]
All right, Luke. But first let's make
a quick visit to the inn. There's
something I need to check there.
!******************************!
[e131_t2.txt]
<@3>Why the inn, Professor?
!******************************!
[e131_t3.txt]
It seems that someone doesn't want
us around, Luke. Someone is, in
fact, after us.<W>
!------------------------------!
And the key to identifying this
scoundrel is back at the inn.

!******************************!
[e131_t4.txt]
<@3>So you already have an idea about
who's behind this?
!******************************!
[e131_t5.txt]
Ha ha! Piqued your interest, have I?
!******************************!
[e132_t0.txt]
Hello, Professor. Is something the
matter? You look a little shaken.
!******************************!
[e132_t1.txt]
Beatrice, I have an urgent request.
Could you show me the newspapers
from the last couple of days?
!******************************!
[e132_t2.txt]
The papers? Certainly. Hang on for
just a moment while I fetch them
for you.
!******************************!
[e132_t3.txt]
That's strange. I'm sure I put them
down around here somewhere.
!******************************!
[e132_t4.txt]
Is there a problem?
!******************************!
[e132_t5.txt]
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I
can't seem to find them anywhere!<W>
!------------------------------!
Even today's morning paper seems
to have gone missing.
!******************************!
[e132_t6.txt]
Hmm.
!******************************!
[e132_t7.txt]
I see.<W> Well, thank you just the
same, Beatrice. This has been
most helpful.
!******************************!
[e132_t8.txt]
<@3>Just what was in those papers
anyway, Professor?
!******************************!
[e133_t0.txt]
Yoo-hoo! Professor Layton!
!******************************!
[e133_t1.txt]
Ramon! And to what do we owe
this visit?
!******************************!
[e133_t2.txt]
Oh, he told me I needed to find you
and bring you to Reinhold Manor.
!******************************!
[e133_t3.txt]
The inspector, I mean. Ahoo hoo
hoo! He and Lady Dahlia await your
arrival at Reinhold Manor.
!******************************!
[e133_t4.txt]
Thank you for the message. We will
set out for the manor in just a
few moments.
!******************************!
[e134_t0.txt]
<@3>You've found the key to the tower,
haven't you?
!******************************!
[e134_t1.txt]
How do you know about the key?
!******************************!
[e134_t2.txt]
<@3>You mustn't interfere with the
tower. Whatever you do, just stay
away from there.
!******************************!
[e134_t3.txt]
Interfere? What do you mean by
that, dear?
!******************************!
[e134_t4.txt]

Welcome back, Professor Layton.
Please come in. Everyone is waiting.
!******************************!
[e135_t1.txt]
Thank you, Matthew.<W> Is something
troubling you, my good man? You
seem ill at ease.
!******************************!
[e135_t2.txt]
Oh, no... I'm fine, sir. Please make
your way to the parlour. 
!******************************!
[e135_t3.txt]
All right, if you're certain that
nothing is the matter, we'll
head upstairs.
!******************************!
[e136_t0.txt]
<@1>Ah, Mr Layton, thank you for
arriving so promptly. Come, have
a seat.
!******************************!
[e136_t1.txt]
Why have you called us here,
Inspector Chelmey?
!******************************!
[e136_t10.txt]
<@1>So go on and give me an alibi,
Layton! Where were you when Simon
was killed? Come on, out with it!
!******************************!
[e136_t11.txt]
I was with Luke, investigating
matters down in the village.
!******************************!
[e136_t12.txt]
<@1>Hrrmph, is that the best you can
muster? It's clear the little brat is
an accomplice to your crime!
!******************************!
[e136_t13.txt]
<@1>Admit it, Layton!<W> You two wanted to
keep the Golden Apple so badly that
you conspired to murder Simon!
!******************************!
[e136_t14.txt]
...
!******************************!
[e136_t15.txt]
<@1>You can't fool me, Layton. So cough
it up and start talking.<W>
!------------------------------!
While I'm at it, I'll take the key to
the tower you picked up, too!
!******************************!
[e136_t16.txt]
It seems that you are intent on
pinning this crime on me, Inspector.<W>
!------------------------------!
But if you are a true enforcer of
the law, you'll acknowledge that I'm
not the only reasonable suspect.<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 0 talk_2&Any member of this household
could have committed the crime.<W>
!------------------------------!
In fact, you can't even rule out the
possibility that everyone here had
a hand in the murder.
!******************************!
[e136_t17.txt]
Furthermore, are we even sure that
a murder took place here?
!******************************!
[e136_t18.txt]
<@1>What kind of nonsense are you
spouting now?<W>
!------------------------------!
Do you really think anyone here is
fooled by your crackpot theories?!
!******************************!
[e136_t19.txt]
<@3>Oh! That's the vase from the
market, isn't it?
!******************************!
[e136_t2.txt]
<@1>Like you, I'm not the kind of man who
beats around the bush, so I'll just
come out with it.
!******************************!
[e136_t20.txt]
<@1>You rotten murderer!
!******************************!
[e136_t21.txt]
<@3>If this vase is evidence, why did you
just break it like it was nothing?
!******************************!
[e136_t22.txt]
...Inspector Chelmey, I'm beginning
to think the only person here with
something to hide is you.
!******************************!
[e136_t23.txt]
<@1>That's absurd. This has nothing in
the slightest to do with me!
!******************************!
[e136_t24.txt]
I've heard you're quite the devoted
husband, Inspector. I bet you take
very good care of your wife, Jane.
!******************************!
[e136_t25.txt]
Luke and I found this article in the
paper.<W> Luke, what was Inspector
Chelmey's favourite food again?
!******************************!
[e136_t3.txt]
<@1>I'm on to you, Layton! It's clear
as day!<W> You are responsible for
Simon's death!
!******************************!
[e136_t4.txt]
Are you suggesting I murdered
Simon?<W> Nonsense.
!******************************!
[e136_t5.txt]
<@1>Nyeh heh heh... Nice, Layton. I have
to admire the way you keep cool
under pressure.<W>
!------------------------------!
But of course, I would expect
nothing less from a cold-blooded
killer such as yourself!
!******************************!
[e136_t6.txt]
<@1>I don't suppose you've seen this
before, eh?
!******************************!
[e136_t7.txt]
<@1>This vase was on display in the
room in which Simon was found dead.<W>
!------------------------------!
All the forensic evidence I've
gathered suggests that the killer
struck Simon with this vase.
!******************************!
[e136_t8.txt]
<@1>Our killer was no professional. You
see, he left his fingerprints all
over the murder weapon.
!******************************!
[e136_t9.txt]
<@1>Fingerprints that match your own,
Mr Layton!
!******************************!
[e137_t0.txt]
Hm...<W> I believe you've confused the
inspector's favourite food with your
own favourite dish, Luke.
!******************************!
[e137_t1.txt]
Hm...<W> I enjoy a juicy roast as much
as the next person, but it doesn't
answer my question, now does it?
!******************************!
[e138_t0.txt]
This article specifically states you
love cakes.<W>
!------------------------------!
And yet you raged at poor Matthew
when he brought you cakes with
tea. Why?
!******************************!
[e138_t1.txt]
<@1>And your point is?! It just so
happens that I have a fondness for
#rJane's#x cakes!
!******************************!
[e138_t10.txt]
But your sudden memory loss
regarding your wife's name isn't the
only suspicious thing about you.
!******************************!
[e138_t11.txt]
Try to recall the time around
Simon's death.
!******************************!
[e138_t12.txt]
You said you received a report
that prompted you to come to St
Mystere. But you forgot one thing.<W>
!------------------------------!
After Luke and I arrived, the
drawbridge that is St Mystere's
sole entrance had its crank stolen.<W>
!------------------------------!
This effectively sealed the village.
From that point on, no one could
enter or leave the village.<W>
!------------------------------!
And do you recall just when this
seclusion began?
!******************************!
[e138_t2.txt]
Is that so...
!******************************!
[e138_t3.txt]
Thank you, Inspector. This little
conversation has made things quite
clear. Please take a look at this.
!******************************!
[e138_t4.txt]
I believe you just called them
"#rJane's#x cakes", yes? I'd like
everyone to look at this article.
!******************************!
[e138_t5.txt]
As you can all see, the article
clearly states that Inspector
Chelmey's wife is #rAmelie#x, not Jane.
!******************************!
[e138_t6.txt]
Do you mean to tell me you've
forgotten your own wife's name?
!******************************!
[e138_t7.txt]
<@1>Grr!

[e149_t0.txt]
Correct. The only route out of the
village had been closed well before
Simon's death was discovered.
!******************************!
[e149_t1.txt]
<@1>Hrmph.
!******************************!
[e149_t10.txt]
Furthermore, I have spoken of what
we found there to no one.<W>
!------------------------------!
There's no conceivable way you
could have known about this key.
!******************************!
[e149_t11.txt]
...Unless, of course, you were spying
on us from the shadows when we
found it.
!******************************!
[e149_t12.txt]
Now let me see if I've got this
correct.<W>
!------------------------------!
You posed as the inspector and
used Simon's death as an excuse
to enter Reinhold Manor. 
!******************************!
[e149_t13.txt]
Since then, you've been waiting for
the ideal time to strike...and steal
the Golden Apple from us.<W>
!------------------------------!
How am I doing so far?
!******************************!
[e149_t14.txt]
<@1>Hrmph...
!******************************!
[e149_t15.txt]
<@1>Nyeh. Nyeh heh heh.
!******************************!
[e149_t16.txt]
<@3>What's so funny? This is no
laughing matter!
!******************************!
[e149_t17.txt]
<@1>I'm just... I'm just astounded at how
despicable I find you, Layton!
!******************************!
[e149_t18.txt]
<@1>But that's exactly why you're
worthy of being my arch-enemy!
!******************************!
[e149_t2.txt]
After that event, there was no way
that anyone could enter the village
from the outside.
!******************************!
[e149_t3.txt]
By the same token, there was no way
to take things out of the village.<W>
!------------------------------!
Particularly something as large as
a corpse. 
!******************************!
[e149_t4.txt]
So tell me, Inspector Chelmey, when
did you actually first set foot in
St Mystere?
!******************************!
[e149_t5.txt]
And furthermore, what did you do
with Simon's remains?
!******************************!
[e149_t6.txt]
<@1>Grr...
!******************************!
[e149_t7.txt]
While we're on the subject, I have
one more nagging question that I
haven't been able to work out.
!******************************!
[e149_t8.txt]
How is it that you knew about the
key to the tower we discovered?
!******************************!
[e149_t9.txt]
When we happened upon that key,
there wasn't a soul in the area,
apart from Luke and myself.
!******************************!
[e150_t0.txt]
<@3>It's a dead end, no two ways about
it. Maybe there's another path
to the tower hidden around here.
!******************************!
[e150_t1.txt]
I'd argue that we've come to
exactly the right spot, Luke.
!******************************!
[e150_t2.txt]
<@3>What do you mean by that?
!******************************!
[e150_t3.txt]
Look right here, Luke. There's a
small indentation in the wall where
one could place a small object.
!******************************!
[e150_t4.txt]
<@3>Oh! So this must be...
!******************************!
[e150_t5.txt]
Yes, this curious indentation is no
doubt the spot indicated in Baron
Reinhold's note to Archibald. 
!******************************!
[e150_t6.txt]
I'm willing to wager that if we put
this in there and gave it a turn...
!******************************!
[e150_t7.txt]
<@3>Wow!
!******************************!
[e150_t8.txt]
Just as I suspected.
!******************************!
[e150_t9.txt]
All right, Luke. In we go.
!******************************!
[e151_t0.txt]
<@3>This place gives me goosebumps.
!******************************!
[e151_t1.txt]
<@3>Plus, it's all murky in here, and I
can't see a thi...
!******************************!
[e151_t2.txt]

<@3>Aaaauuurgh!
!******************************!
[e152_t0.txt]
<@3>Ughh... My head...
!******************************!
[e152_t1.txt]
Luke! Are you all right, my boy? No
injuries, I hope!
!******************************!
[e152_t10.txt]
<@3>Look, there are stairs over there.
Let's get out of here! This place
gives me the shivers!
!******************************!
[e152_t11.txt]
Yes, you're quite right, Luke. Let's
head out.
!******************************!
[e152_t2.txt]
<@3>Don't worry, Professor. I'm fine.
And yourself?
!******************************!
[e152_t3.txt]
Nothing a good long bath later
won't solve. But more importantly...
Where are we?
!******************************!
[e152_t4.txt]
<@3>This room is full of
curious machines. I've never
seen anything like them.<W>
!------------------------------!
What do you suppose they do?
!******************************!
[e152_t5.txt]
<@3>What in the world? Look over there
on the wall, Professor!
!******************************!
[e152_t6.txt]
My word!
!******************************!
[e152_t7.txt]
There are pictures of the villagers
displayed here...<W>
!------------------------------!
And what's this?<W>
There's a key for 
almost every villager...
!******************************!
[e152_t8.txt]
<@3>Professor, what if somebody is
using this place to keep an eye on
what's going on in St Mystere?
!******************************!
[e152_t9.txt]
Hm.
!******************************!
[e153_t0.txt]
What's this?!
!******************************!
[e153_t1.txt]
You!
!******************************!
[e153_t10.txt]
Precisely.<W> Do you know anything
that could be of help to us?
!******************************!
[e153_t11.txt]
Hmm... So that's how it is, eh?
!******************************!
[e153_t12.txt]
What you're looking for is on the
top floor of the tower.<W>
!------------------------------!
But watch out, 'cause the puzzles in
this tower are harder than a
diamond-tipped drill.<W>
!------------------------------!
I know they call you a puzzle master,
but are you sure you have what it
takes to solve them?
!******************************!
[e153_t13.txt]
<@3>Now why would you go and tell us
something like that?<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 2 angry&I bet you just want to set us up to
walk right into some sort of trap!
!******************************!
[e153_t14.txt]
Hrmph. What would I possibly gain
from doing something like that?
!******************************!
[e153_t15.txt]
Not to mention, it's my duty to
guide those who seek the Golden
Apple towards their goal.
!******************************!
[e153_t16.txt]
Some mischief maker sneaked into the
village and had me all confused, but
I think I've worked things out now.
!******************************!
[e153_t17.txt]
Seeing as how it's your duty and all
that would you mind filling us in?
What is St Mystere's big secret?
!******************************!
[e153_t18.txt]
...All right.
!******************************!
[e153_t19.txt]
The name is Bruno.<W> I work for the
Reinhold family.<W>
!------------------------------!
For some time now, I've managed
St Mystere from up here in
the tower.
!******************************!
[e153_t2.txt]
Grmph!
!******************************!
[e153_t20.txt]
Managed St Mystere... You're the
one who manages the "life" of each
of the villagers, aren't you?
!******************************!
[e153_t21.txt]
<@3>What in the world are you two
talking about?
!******************************!
[e153_t22.txt]
Surely you must have seen
them too, Luke.<W>
!------------------------------!
Do you recall the cogs we found
about the village and the 
keys we just saw?
!******************************!
[e153_t23.txt]
All the villagers in St Mystere are
robots created by Bruno.
!******************************!
[e153_t24.txt]
<@3>What do you mean?! The villagers
are all robots?!
!******************************!
[e153_t25.txt]
In other words, the inhabitants of
St Mystere aren't human, but
intricately constructed machines.<W>
!------------------------------!
They're robots, my boy.<W>
!------------------------------!
I have to say, I'm astonished that
anyone could build such elaborate
machines in this day and age.<W>
!------------------------------!
You must be quite the engineer, sir.
!******************************!
[e153_t26.txt]
Ho ho, aren't you a sharp one! I
never imagined you'd work out so
much of the mystery by yourself. 
!******************************!
[e153_t27.txt]
<@3>What do you mean, sir?
!******************************!
[e153_t28.txt]
St Mystere isn't a real village, Luke.
It was constructed by Bruno and
the late baron.
!******************************!
[e153_t29.txt]
How am I doing so far, Bruno?
!******************************!
[e153_t3.txt]
You two again!<W> &SetAni 0 point&What are you doing
here?! What are you up to?!
!******************************!
[e153_t30.txt]
Erm... You're absolutely correct.
!******************************!
[e153_t31.txt]
Master believed that one day an
heir worthy of his fortune would
come forward.<W>
!------------------------------!
He had me build this village and all
who dwell within it to prepare for
that day.
!******************************!
[e153_t32.txt]
Then he hid his greatest treasure,
the Golden Apple, away on the top
floor of this tower.<W><@C>
I was ordered to protect it
with my life.
!******************************!
[e153_t33.txt]
Until the person arrives who can
solve the puzzle of the Golden
Apple, I will continue to protect it.
!******************************!
[e153_t34.txt]
<@3>Remarkable. I'm impressed at how
far Baron Reinhold went to protect
his treasure.
!******************************!
[e153_t35.txt]
It's not just any treasure, mind you.
The Golden Apple was the baron's
most precious treasure.
!******************************!
[e153_t36.txt]
<@3>But why go through all this just to
hide treasure? Why build an entire
village to protect it?
!******************************!
[e153_t37.txt]
Huhwhoops! Seems I've been a little
loose-lipped here. I've already said
more than I should've.<W>
!------------------------------!
The answers you're looking for
are waiting for you at the top of
the tower.
!******************************!
[e153_t38.txt]
Go on then. Show me if you're the
one who can solve the puzzle of
the Golden Apple.
!******************************!
[e153_t4.txt]
Just a moment, sir. What are you
talking about?
!******************************!
[e153_t5.txt]
I knew it! You came here to steal my
secrets, didn't you?<W> Didn't you?!<W>
!------------------------------!
Don't play dumb with me! I see
right through you! Don't think I
haven't been watching!
!******************************!
[e153_t6.txt]
I've seen you two sniffing around
every nook and cranny in the
village, obstructing my work!<W><@C>
&SetAni 0 point&Now I've had it, so unless you want
trouble, give me back Number 38!
!******************************!
[e153_t7.txt]
Please calm yourself, sir. Just
listen to what we have to say for
a moment.<W>
!------------------------------!
We haven't intended to get in the
way of your work. We are merely
searching for the Golden Apple.<W>
!------------------------------!
Neither of us knows anything about
this Number 38 busine...
!******************************!
[e153_t8.txt]

[e165_t1.txt]
Yes, it was a bit unnerving. But he
also provided us with the answer
to one of our ongoing mysteries.<W>

Do you remember that awful noise

Reinhold Manor?

was likely Don Paolo's contraption
making a crash landing.<W>

If that's the case, then we now know
the approximate time of Don
Paolo's entrance into St Mystere.
!******************************!
[e165_t4.txt]
<@3>That makes perfect sense. So, it
follows that Franco wouldn't have
noticed Don Paolo's entrance.<W>

that everyone's been looking for...<W>

That means the treasure that Lady
Dahlia and the others were chasing
never existed in the first place!

[e165_t5.txt]
No, I'm fairly certain they weren't
mistaken. I do believe a fortune is
hidden somewhere within the village.
!******************************!
[e165_t6.txt]
But the baron would need to hide it
somewhere only the Golden Apple
would know to look.
!******************************!
[e165_t7.txt]
<@3>You mean that Flora knows where
the treasure is hidden?
!******************************!
[e165_t8.txt]
<@3>I'm sorry, but I don't know about
a treasure or anything like that...

one more time. I suspect we'll clear
everything up there.

treasure could be located here?

I'm sure it holds the key to the
Reinhold fortune.
!******************************!
[e166_t2.txt]
<@3>But I've already looked at it!
!******************************!

[e168_t13.txt]
My dear Flora, has the village
watched over you as I would have?<W>
!------------------------------!
I built St Mystere for you so that
you would never have to know
true loneliness.<W>
!------------------------------!
Well...to be fair, Bruno did the
actual building, but that's beside
the point.<W>
!------------------------------!
In any case, if you've come this far,
I suppose it's safe to assume my
plan was a success.
!******************************!
[e168_t14.txt]
My greatest regret is that I'm not
there to see you become a
young woman.<W>
!------------------------------!
But please know that I want nothing
more than for you to be happy.<W>
!------------------------------!
Whether the person by your side
right now can give you that or
not is up to you, I suppose.
!******************************!
[e168_t15.txt]
And to you who have found your way
to my daughter's side, you have my
heartiest congratulations.<W>
!------------------------------!
Few could make it through the
barrage of puzzles I set before you.<W>
!------------------------------!
I imagine a person of your abilities
has already caught on, but allow me
to reveal St Mystere's secret.
!******************************!
[e168_t16.txt]
<@3>The secret of St Mystere?
!******************************!
[e168_t17.txt]
Recently, I was told by my physician
that I don't have much time left
on this earth.<W>
!------------------------------!
I can come to terms with dying, but
the thought of leaving my only child
alone in the world torments me.<W>
!------------------------------!
This is why I've commissioned Bruno
to construct St Mystere.<W>
!------------------------------!
At least this way, she'll be safe and
protected until she's old enough to
venture into the outside world.
!******************************!
[e168_t18.txt]
Streets and buildings are the bones
of a village, but its heart is the
people who live in it.<W>
!------------------------------!
This is why I asked Bruno to create
all the villagers here, as well as all
the puzzles hidden within them.<W>
!------------------------------!
I've asked Matthew to make news of
my death public only once Flora has
grown past childhood.<W>
!------------------------------!
So, stranger, how does my beautiful
little flower look now? I imagine
she's blossoming into adulthood.
!******************************!
[e168_t19.txt]
Equally important to me is finding
someone to whom I can entrust
both my daughter and my fortune.<W>
!------------------------------!
This is why the inhabitants of St
Mystere are constantly testing the
knowledge of the visitor.<W>
!------------------------------!
If you've made it this far, it must
mean that you possess both wisdom
and dedication to my daughter.
!******************************!
[e168_t2.txt]
Listen closely, Luke.<W>
!------------------------------!
Wisdom wasn't the only thing Baron
Reinhold required of potential
guardians for his only daughter.
!******************************!
[e168_t20.txt]
I am confident that you will take
good care of my fortune and Flora.<W>
!------------------------------!
This is why everything in this room,
the whole of my fortune, belongs to
you now.<W>
!------------------------------!
When you remove it from here, St
Mystere will complete the objective
for which it was created.<W>
!------------------------------!
I imagine the inhabitants will fall
into a deep sleep from which they
are never to awaken.
!******************************!
[e168_t21.txt]
<@3>Now wait just a minute! Is he saying
that if we take the treasure, all of
St Mystere will just disappear?
!******************************!
[e168_t22.txt]
I honestly don't know the answer to
that question, Luke.<W>
!------------------------------!
But it's possible that St Mystere is
designed to shut down the instant
we lay a hand on the treasure.
!******************************!
[e168_t23.txt]
<@3>So if that happens, everyone will
just...stop?<W> Just like puppets
with their strings cut?!
!******************************!
[e168_t24.txt]
I leave it to you, brave traveller.
Draw the curtain on St Mystere and
lay this lifeless village to rest.<W>
!------------------------------!
Above all else, take care of my
precious daughter. She's in your
hands now.
!******************************!
[e168_t25.txt]
<@3>Oh, Papa...
!******************************!
[e168_t26.txt]
<@3>I can't believe it. If we even touch
this treasure, all of St Mystere will
just grind to a halt.
!******************************!
[e168_t27.txt]
Flora, by right, this inheritance
belongs to you. You should be the
one to decide what's done with it.
!******************************!
[e168_t28.txt]
<@3>I... I don't want it.
!******************************!
[e168_t29.txt]
But why ever not, my dear?
!******************************!
[e168_t3.txt]
You saw it too, did you not? That
peculiar mark on her neck that only
appeared once she laughed?
!******************************!
[e168_t30.txt]
<@3>The people who live here have been
with me for so long. Curious as this
village is, it's watched me grow up.
!******************************!
[e168_t31.txt]
<@3>I want St Mystere, my village, to
stay just as it is...forever.
!******************************!
[e168_t32.txt]
I see.<W> Then so it shall be.<W> But what
of you, Flora? Will you stay here
with your village?
!******************************!
[e168_t33.txt]
<@3>I... I...
!******************************!
[e168_t4.txt]
In other words, Baron Reinhold set
out one last requirement for the
potential inheritor to his fortune.
!******************************!
[e168_t5.txt]
He wanted someone who could
make Flora smile again after losing
those dear to her.
!******************************!
[e168_t6.txt]
To that person and that person
alone would Baron Reinhold reveal
the location of his actual fortune.
!******************************!
[e168_t7.txt]
<@3>That's unbelievable, Professor! But
it all makes sense now!
!******************************!
[e168_t8.txt]
Flora... My little Flora...
!******************************!
[e168_t9.txt]
Where's that voice coming from?
!******************************!
[e169_t0.txt]
Think back on what we've seen here
in St Mystere.
!******************************!
[e169_t1.txt]
A mysterious roar from the tower...
People vanishing off the street...
!******************************!
[e169_t10.txt]
That elderly man Bruno repairs the
villagers when something inside
them wears out or breaks.
!******************************!
[e169_t11.txt]
That terrible din we heard was most
likely the sound of the machines we
saw in the cellar of the tower.
!******************************!
[e169_t12.txt]
<@3>So, when Ramon disappeared...
!******************************!
[e169_t13.txt]
Yes, my boy, that's right. Ramon was
sent back after Bruno finished
his repairs.<W>
!------------------------------!
I'd wager that's the case for
everyone who disappears.
!******************************!
[e169_t2.txt]
And now, we find the names of all
the villagers in a room of the
strange tower.
!******************************!
[e169_t3.txt]
<@3>Just what are you getting at
here, Professor?
!******************************!
[e169_t4.txt]
All these events were put into
motion the moment I opened that
letter from Lady Dahlia.
!******************************!
[e169_t5.txt]
Baron Reinhold set up this mystery
as a way to find a worthy guardian
for his daughter.
!******************************!
[e169_t6.txt]
It seems that the entirety of
St Mystere was constructed to
protect Flora.
!******************************!
[e169_t7.txt]
In other words...<W><@C>
Everything here, from the shops to
the villagers, was created for the
sole purpose of protecting Flora.
!******************************!
[e169_t8.txt]
The villagers of St Mystere are
all robots, Luke.
!******************************!
[e169_t9.txt]
<@3>What?!
!******************************!
[e170_t0.txt]
Not even in my wildest dreams would
I ever have imagined an entire
village of robots!
!******************************!
[e170_t1.txt]
I've commissioned Bruno with the
construction of St Mystere.
!******************************!
[e170_t2.txt]
The village is ready to find the
person to whom I can entrust both
my daughter and my fortune.
!******************************!
[e170_t3.txt]
When you take the treasure, the
village will have completed the
purpose for which it was created.
!******************************!
[e170_t4.txt]
It's my hope that if someone is
capable enough to solve the many
challenges I've laid out...<W>
!------------------------------!
This person can also be entrusted
with my fortune and my daughter.
!******************************!
[e170_t5.txt]
<@3>Oh...
!******************************!
[e170_t6.txt]
Flora, by right, this inheritance
belongs to you. You should be the
one to decide what's done with it.
!******************************!
[e170_t7.txt]
<@3>I...I don't need it.
!******************************!
[e170_t8.txt]
Are you certain about that?
!******************************!
[e170_t9.txt]
<@3>I just want my village to stay as it
is...forever.

here, would you? I'm in a real pickle.
!******************************!
[e172_t1.txt]
What seems to be the problem, sir?
!******************************!
[e172_t2.txt]
<@1>&SetAni 1 talk&Some fool went and raised
the bridge while I was on my break.
&SetAni 1 mufu&Hrmph!<W>
!------------------------------!
&SetAni 1 talk&Then, as if that wasn't bad enough,
that scoundrel made off with my
only bridge crank! &SetAni 1 mufu&Hrmph!
!******************************!
[e172_t3.txt]
Oh, dear. So you mean to say...
!******************************!
[e172_t4.txt]
<@1>Hrmph!<W>&SetAni 1 talk& That's right. Until that
thing turns up, no one is getting in
or out of the village! &SetAni 1 mufu&
!******************************!
[e172_t5.txt]
<@1>I'm still looking for the blasted
crank, but I'm too furious
to get anything done!<W> Hrmph!<W>
!------------------------------!
What kind of person would do
something like this, anyway?!
!******************************!
[e172_t6.txt]
<@1>&SetAni 1 talk&Oh, yeah!<W> I found this in the
street when I was out looking
for my crank.<W>
!------------------------------!
Got any idea what it is?
!******************************!
[e172_t7.txt]
The gizmos option has been added
to the menu.<W>
!------------------------------!
Touch the trunk to open it,
then tap the Gizmos icon.<W>
!------------------------------!
From here, you can see the
various mechanical parts you've
gathered around the village.
!******************************!
[e173_t0.txt]
I'm sorry, young lady, could you help
us? We're looking for someone, you
see, and...
!******************************!
[e173_t1.txt]
<@3>Sorry, can't help you.<W> And by
"can't", I mean "don't want to".<W>
!------------------------------!
I've barely even talked to Ramon,
and I have NO interest in this
search.<W> Hee hee hee hee!<W>
!------------------------------!
But! Maybe if you helped me solve
this puzzle, I just might, you know,
remember something.<W> Tee hee.
!******************************!
[e173_t2.txt]
And just who do you think you are,
young lady?!
!******************************!
[e173_t3.txt]
<@3>Tee hee hee! You could try all night
and you'd still probably never get
the answer.
!******************************!
[e173_t4.txt]
<@3>Tee hee hee. Weren't you supposed
to be looking for someone, grandad?
!******************************!
[e173_t5.txt]
<@3>Tee hee hee!<W>
!------------------------------!
Y'know, I've heard that if you aren't
careful walking around St Mystere
at night, you can run into trouble.<W>
!------------------------------!
I bet Ramon wasn't being careful...
!******************************!
[e173_t6.txt]
What exactly do you mean?
!******************************!
[e173_t7.txt]
...
!******************************!
[e173_t8.txt]
<@3>Tee hee hee! Nice one, grandad.<W>
Looks like the gears need
a little oiling, huh?!
!******************************!
[e174_t0.txt]
Excuse me, so sorry to bother you
again.<W> Have you seen Ramon since
we spoke last?
!******************************!
[e174_t1.txt]
<@1>Yaaawn...
!******************************!
[e174_t10.txt]
<@1>And remember, Beatrice from the
inn was the one to find Gerard's
watch.<W>
!------------------------------!
Don't forget to ask her about it,
OK? OK, see you tomorrow!<W> Yaaawn.
!******************************!
[e174_t11.txt]
<@1>Hey, I thought you were gonna help
me with this!<W> I guess it's up to me.
!******************************!
[e174_t12.txt]
<@1>Yaaawn...
!******************************!
[e174_t13.txt]
<@1>Mmm? Gerard lost something again?<W>
I think he's getting a bit slow.
He's always dropping stuff.<W>
!------------------------------!
So, what'd he drop this time?<W> Let
me guess, was it a wristwatch, hm?
!******************************!
[e174_t14.txt]
Indeed, he did drop a wristwatch.<W>
Did you pick it up around here?
!******************************!
[e174_t15.txt]
<@1>Ahem.<W> Well, actually, no, because
Beatrice was the one who
found it.<W>
!------------------------------!
Thing is, it was already late when
she found it, so she decided to hold
on to it until morning.<W>
!------------------------------!
Go to the inn, and you can probably
ask her for it.
!******************************!
[e174_t2.txt]
Come, Luke. Let's go.
!******************************!
[e174_t3.txt]
Event Text174_3[[0D]]

!******************************!
[e174_t4.txt]
<@1>So there you go. Now that I've got
your attention, could you give me a
hand and solve this puzzle?<W>
!------------------------------!
Dark places really scare me, but I
wanted to solve this puzzle so much
I came out here for help.<W>
!------------------------------!
The puzzle is all about stars,
you see. Maybe you can make sense
of the thing? Mmm?
!******************************!
[e174_t5.txt]
Of course. I'd be happy to help you
with it.
!******************************!
[e174_t6.txt]
<@1>Hey, come on! I'm begging you. I
don't want to stay outside in the
dark anymore. It's just too scary!
!******************************!
[e174_t7.txt]
<@1>Yaaawn...<W> Uh-oh, I think I might have
forgotten how to get home.
!******************************!
[e174_t8.txt]
<@1>Augh! It's pitch black out here and
I don't know how to get home!<W> I'd
better just stay here.
!******************************!
[e174_t9.txt]
<@1>Hey, thanks so much! I can finally
go home and get some sleep.
!******************************!
[e175_t0.txt]
Oh, so you found my watch, did you?
!******************************!
[e175_t1.txt]
But of course. A gentleman always
helps those in distress.<W>
Speaking of which...<W>
!------------------------------!
We're still quite worried about
Ramon's whereabouts and should
probably return to our search now.
!******************************!
[e175_t10.txt]
All right then. Thanks again.
You really helped me out.

!******************************!
[e175_t11.txt]
Oh, come on, fellows! You're young
and spry! Help an old man out!
!******************************!
[e175_t12.txt]
The air has taken on quite a chill.
Don't you think it'd be best to head
home, sir?
!******************************!
[e175_t2.txt]
Yep, St Mystere is strange like
that. Despite its size, it can be
quite challenging to find people.<W>
!------------------------------!
It can feel like running around
a maze.<W> Speaking of mazes, you
ever heard of this one, laddie?
!******************************!
[e175_t3.txt]
But we really must be...
!******************************!
[e175_t4.txt]
You can try this puzzle as many
times as you like. If there's one
thing I've got, it's time.
!******************************!
[e175_t5.txt]
Look at me, living it up with a
bunch of youngsters! Why, I feel
like a teenager again. Thank you!
!******************************!
[e175_t6.txt]
Think nothing of it, sir.
!******************************!
[e175_t7.txt]
You know, I feel so chipper, I think
I'll stay out here a bit longer!
!******************************!
[e175_t8.txt]
You're a sharp one, laddie!<W>
!------------------------------!
You know, if you're looking for
someone, you should ask around at
the inn or cafe.<W>
!------------------------------!
As you know, the inn is right by the
entrance to the village.<W>
!------------------------------!
The cafe is right at the fork in the
road just north of here.
!******************************!
[e175_t9.txt]
We've already searched the inn, but
checking the cafe sounds like a
good idea. We'll be sure to stop by.
!******************************!
[e176_t0.txt]
<@3>Good evening to you, sir. It's almost
my bedtime, but I've got one more
puzzle for you. Want to see it?
!******************************!
[e176_t1.txt]
<@3>Let me guess, you want to try that
puzzle again, don't you? Hee hee! I
knew it!
!******************************!
[e176_t2.txt]
<@3>Everyone says that going out at
night in St Mystere is dangerous,
but no kidnapper's gonna get me.<W>
!------------------------------!
First of all, I can run REALLY fast,
and I'm a great screamer.<W>
!------------------------------!
Second, the people who disappeared
kept complaining of feeling tired,
but I feel great all the time.
!******************************!
[e176_t3.txt]
<@3>How'd you like my puzzle? Good
fun, right?<W> You did such a good job,
I'll tell you a secret!<W>
!------------------------------!
I heard that there's a man-eating
monster in the tower, and that's
why everyone stays away.<W>
!------------------------------!
I'm not silly enough to think there's
actually a monster inside, but the
place is dangerous.<W>
!------------------------------!
So be careful in there, mister!
!******************************!
[e176_t4.txt]
<@3>Aw, is my puzzle too hard, sir?
But you look so clever, I thought
you'd finish my puzzle in no time!
!******************************!
[e177_t0.txt]
<@3>Professor, there's a cat here! Aww!
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!<W>
!******************************!
[e177_t1.txt]
Animals are very dear to you,
aren't they, Luke? Well, I have just
the puzzle for you then.
!******************************!
[e177_t2.txt]
Wonderful job there, Luke.
!******************************!
[e177_t3.txt]
Come now, Luke, you can solve this
one. Think about it critically.
!******************************!
[e177_t4.txt]
Here's that cat puzzle again.
!******************************!
[e177_t5.txt]
<@3>I don't know what it is about cats,
Professor. I'm just a big softie
when it comes to them.
!******************************!
[e178_t0.txt]
<@1>Hey, out looking for Ramon, are
you? Yep, you're definitely looking
for Ramon.<W>
!------------------------------!
So, you still haven't found the guy?<W>
Listen, streets here are dangerous
at night. Highly dangerous!<W>
!------------------------------!
You can't go running 'round
the village with a kid!<W> 'Cause that's
dangerous! Highly dangerous!<W>
!------------------------------!
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to punish
your poor judgment with a puzzle.
But you'll solve it, yeah? 'Course!
!******************************!
[e178_t1.txt]
<@1>What's that? You want to try my
puzzle again? Well, I won't stop you,
that's for sure.
!******************************!
[e178_t2.txt]
<@1>Do yourselves a favour and go back
to the inn for the night. Wisest
thing to do is go home and sleep.
!******************************!
[e178_t3.txt]
<@1>Well, it looks like you solved it, all
right.<W> Of course, we all knew a
brainbox like you would solve it.<W>
!------------------------------!
If you're looking for the cafe, it's
right there.<W> But it's way past that
kid's bedtime, y'know! Way past!<W>
!------------------------------!
Besides, the tower could start
making noise again at any time.<W>
!------------------------------!
Trust me on this one, Professor.
Get back to the inn, yeah? Yeah!
Back to the inn.
!******************************!
[e178_t4.txt]
<@1>What's the matter, you can't solve
it?<W> You let me down, Professor.
You really disappointed me there.
!******************************!
[e179_t0.txt]
Hello there, boys. Turning in for
the night already?
!******************************!
[e179_t1.txt]
Not yet, I'm afraid. We're still out
surveying the village.<W> By the way,
have you seen Ramon today?
!******************************!
[e179_t10.txt]
Oh, yes. And just out of curiosity,
you haven't seen Ramon about
lately, have you?
!******************************!
[e179_t11.txt]
What's that, Professor? 
Ramon? I reckon he's in the cafe.
!******************************!
[e179_t12.txt]
Ah yes, that's right.
!******************************!
[e179_t2.txt]
Ramon?<W> That skinny man with the
big purple lips?<W> No, he hasn't come
by today.<W>
!------------------------------!
But you know, for all his fancy
clothing, I hear he's actually quite
the layabout.<W>
!------------------------------!
He's probably off idling at the cafe.<W>
Why not go check for him there?
!******************************!
[e179_t3.txt]
...I see.<W> If that's the case, I'd like
to go to the cafe right away.<W>
!------------------------------!
Do you mind keeping the front door
open a little longer?
!******************************!
[e179_t4.txt]
Oh, don't you worry, Professor.<W>
Another guest arrived to stay the
night, and I'm setting up his room.<W>
!------------------------------!
Besides, my door is always open
for a dashing gentleman such
as yourself.
!******************************!
[e179_t5.txt]
Good evening, Beatrice. I heard
that you found a wristwatch
out by the entrance to the park.
!******************************!
[e179_t6.txt]
Oh, that old thing? Does it belong
to you, Professor?
!******************************!
[e179_t7.txt]
Oh, no, it's Gerard's. He dropped it
today while wandering about,
and asked me to help him find it.
!******************************!
[e179_t8.txt]
Why am I not surprised? That man
sheds more stuff than a cat sitting
by a fireplace.<W>
!------------------------------!
All right then, here's that watch.<W>
You know, it makes sense that it
belongs to Gerard.<W>
!------------------------------!
I was just thinking to myself, "The
professor is far too fashionable
to wear this old thing".
!******************************!
[e179_t9.txt]
Ha ha ha! Thank you very much.
!******************************!
[e180_t0.txt]
Oh, fancy meeting you here.<W> I've got
a really tough puzzle right now. It's
harder to crack than a coconut.<W>
!------------------------------!
And who knows, it might even have
something to do with the case
you're investigating.<W>
!------------------------------!
So what do you say?<W> Help a fellow
detective out, will you, brother?
!******************************!
[e180_t1.txt]
That's all very interesting, but I do
believe there's been a mistake here.
I'm no detective, you see.
!******************************!
[e180_t2.txt]
Say no more! Undercover and all
that then, yes? Very well, but I know
a fellow sleuth when I see one.<W>
!------------------------------!
Us being in the same trade and all,
I suppose it couldn't hurt if I let
you have a look at this puzzle.
!******************************!
[e180_t3.txt]
Ho ho! You've done it! You've solved
that monster of a riddle.<W> Simply
astounding! Even I couldn't do it!
!******************************!
[e180_t4.txt]
Oh, it wasn't that difficult.<W> But on
a more pressing note, have you
heard from Ramon lately?
!******************************!
[e180_t5.txt]
What's that you say, good sir? You
want to solve more puzzles?<W> All
right, then here's a gem of a tip.<W>
!------------------------------!
Go visit Granny Riddleton's shack.
That's all I can say!<W>
!------------------------------!
My detective's instinct tells me
that another case is developing as
we speak.<W>
!------------------------------!
Perhaps I'll see you again tomorrow.
!******************************!
[e180_t6.txt]
Ho ho ho! As suspected, this mind
boggler takes quite a bit of time
and mental fortitude to crack.<W>
!------------------------------!
So fret not.<W> Even a top mind like me
struggles with puzzles. This one has
stumped me for nearly a year now.
!******************************!
[e180_t7.txt]
Try the puzzle again if you wish, but
don't expect to find an answer. I've
been stuck on this one for a year.

<@3>What is it, Professor?
!******************************!
[e185_t2.txt]
<@3>Look at this poster... The picture
appears to be the same as the one
on the ticket we picked up.<W>
!------------------------------!
It looks like it's been posted here
for ages. It's so faded, you can't
even read the letters.
!******************************!
[e185_t3.txt]
<@3>Oh!
!******************************!
[e185_t4.txt]
<@3>Hey, isn't that...
!******************************!
[e185_t5.txt]
<@3>Yes, I thought so!<W> That's little
Flora there in the middle of the
picture, isn't it?<W>
!------------------------------!
She looks exactly as she does in
the portrait we saw of her in
Reinhold Manor.
!******************************!
[e185_t6.txt]
It would seem that Baron Reinhold
built this amusement park solely
for his daughter's enjoyment.<W>
!------------------------------!
Strange, I wonder why it wasn't
more popular with the village folk
once it was opened to the public. 
!******************************!
[e185_t7.txt]
...Well, I don't suppose speculation
will help us very much. Let's
keep moving.
!******************************!
[e185_t8.txt]
<@3>Right you are, Professor.
!******************************!
[e186_t0.txt]
<@1>Imagine... A murder in this very
house.<W> It brings a chill to my spine,
it does.<W>
!------------------------------!
You're a detective, are you not?<W>
Do hurry and find the monster that
did this.
!******************************!
[e186_t1.txt]
My good sir, I am no detective.<W>
But I agree that your concerns
are certainly warranted.<W>
!------------------------------!
No one is safe until that criminal is
behind bars.

<@1>My sentiments exactly.<W> I just don't
understand it. Simon could be snide,
but he wasn't the type to be hated.<W>
!------------------------------!
If the criminal was after my
brother's fortune, I could very well
be this fiend's next target!
!******************************!
[e186_t3.txt]
You have a point.<W>
!------------------------------!
If we narrow the motive to stealing
the Reinhold fortune, there are
fewer potential suspects...
!******************************!
[e186_t4.txt]
<@1>Good gracious, you don't think I'd
do something like this now?!<W>
!------------------------------!
Simon and I got along very well, I'll
have you know. He wasn't very close
to Augustus though.<W>
!------------------------------!
You know, all this talk of families
has me contemplating a puzzle I
once heard.
!******************************!
[e186_t5.txt]
<@1>Ah yes, back to try that puzzle
once more?
!******************************!
[e186_t6.txt]
<@1>Poor Simon, murdered right here. I'm
absolutely terrified. Bring this
criminal to justice, I beg you.
!******************************!
[e186_t7.txt]
<@1>Ah yes, so that's the answer.<W>
!------------------------------!
Thank you for clearing up that
puzzle, but we're still no closer to
finding Simon's killer.<W>
!------------------------------!
I assure you I had nothing to do
with it, so please go out and find
the real murderer!
!******************************!
[e186_t8.txt]
Of course.<W> I understand your
position. It appears I am a suspect
too. I'll find out what I can.
!******************************!
[e186_t9.txt]
<@1>Oh...<W> Giving up already? I was told
that you were a greater man than
that, Professor.
!******************************!
[e187_t0.txt]
<@3>Oh, Professor, how fortunate that
you're here at a time like this. I
have a favour to ask of you.
!******************************!
[e187_t1.txt]
Please, madam, ask away. I'm happy
to come to your aid in any way I can.
!******************************!
[e187_t2.txt]
<@3>Thank you, Professor.<W>
!------------------------------!
Could you solve this puzzle for me?<W>
Though I'm not feeling up to the
challenge, it won't solve itself.
!******************************!
[e187_t3.txt]
<@3>Have you given some more thought
to the puzzle?
!******************************!
[e187_t4.txt]
<@3>I'd like to be left alone for a little
while, Professor. I need some time
to collect my thoughts.
!******************************!
[e187_t5.txt]
<@3>What a relief! I can finally stop
thinking about that silly puzzle.<W> You
have my thanks.

<@3>Some help you are!
!******************************!
[e188_t0.txt]
<@1>By the way, Mr Layton, I hear you're
something of a puzzle connoisseur.<W>
!------------------------------!
This puzzle was popular in London
when I left.<W> I wonder if you have
what it takes to solve it.
!******************************!
[e188_t1.txt]
<@1>Can't stand admitting defeat, eh?
Very well then, you can try this
puzzle again.
!******************************!
[e188_t2.txt]
<@1>My, my, our murderer is quite the
slippery one.<W> But rest assured,
Mr Layton.<W>
!------------------------------!
There isn't a criminal alive that can
outwit me. I'll have him behind bars
before you know it.
!******************************!
[e188_t3.txt]
<@1>Hmph. I suppose I should have given
you a tougher puzzle to solve.<W>
!------------------------------!
You'd do best to use that brain
of yours to find that Golden Apple
everyone is abuzz about.
!******************************!
[e188_t4.txt]
<@1>Really, Mr Layton...<W>
!------------------------------!
How do you expect to crack the
case of the Golden Apple when you
can't even solve a simple puzzle?
!******************************!
[e189_t0.txt]
A small cog?<W> Now that you mention
it, I know a puzzle about an object
that almost fits that description.
!******************************!
[e189_t1.txt]
<@3>Whaaat? Are you joking?<W> A puzzle?
At a time like this?
!******************************!
[e189_t10.txt]
Oh dear, please excuse my insolence.<W>
Honestly, spouting off puzzles at a
time like this!<W>
!------------------------------!
The murder has me shaken up, and I'm
afraid I'm not thinking clearly.
!******************************!
[e189_t11.txt]
This is not proper behaviour for a
born-and-bred butler like myself.
!******************************!
[e189_t12.txt]
Not at all, Matthew. It's been quite
a day for all involved, and it's only
natural you'd feel out of sorts.<W>
!------------------------------!
Why don't you go and rest for a
little bit? I think you would feel
much better.
!******************************!
[e189_t13.txt]
Thank you for your consideration,
Professor. I appreciate your
concern very much.<W>
!------------------------------!
Still, why would someone do this to
poor Simon? The question is eating
away at me.
!******************************!
[e189_t14.txt]
I beg your forgiveness, Professor.<W>
!------------------------------!
You see, I just can't fathom it.
What reason would anyone have to
hurt Simon?
!******************************!
[e189_t2.txt]
Won't you please solve this puzzle
for me, sir?
!******************************!
[e189_t3.txt]
If there's anything I can do to aid
your investigation, please don't
hesitate to ask, sir.
!******************************!
[e189_t4.txt]
Thank you, Matthew.
!******************************!
[e189_t5.txt]
My apologies, but I'm afraid I don't
know anything that would aid
your investigation.
!******************************!
[e189_t6.txt]
Not at all. This small cog is more
than enough for us to go on.
!******************************!
[e189_t7.txt]
But I do wonder why you're giving
this to us.
!******************************!
[e189_t8.txt]
I believe you are a good man,
Professor.<W> I'm confident you will
piece together this puzzle.
!******************************!
[e189_t9.txt]
I appreciate the vote of
confidence, Matthew.
!******************************!
[e190_t0.txt]
Well, if it isn't Claudia, out and
about.<W> And that reminds me of a
puzzle. Give it a try, my boy.
!******************************!
[e190_t1.txt]
That's the spirit. I'm certain you'll
make sense of the puzzle this
time around.
!******************************!
[e190_t2.txt]
<@3>I thought Lady Dahlia was full of hot
air when she said Claudia needed to
be by her side at all times.<W>
!------------------------------!
I guess we didn't really need to run
ourselves ragged chasing Claudia
around the village after all...
!******************************!
[e190_t3.txt]
Once you realise how you need to
look at things, it's not a terribly
difficult problem, now is it?
!******************************!
[e190_t4.txt]
Don't be discouraged. You probably
just need to think things through
a bit more.
!******************************!
[e191_t0.txt]
<@1>Why should I tell you anything if you
won't even do me the decency of
telling me who you're looking for?<@P><@C>
Now, does that sound right? It
doesn't sound right, right? Yeah,
brainbox, you hear what I'm saying.
!******************************!
[e191_t1.txt]
If you must know, we are searching
for Ramon, a servant under the
employ of the Reinhold family.
!******************************!
[e191_t2.txt]
<@1>No idea. Seriously,<W> I know
nothing.<W> I saw nothing. Nope, not a
thing.<W> GOT IT?!<W>
!------------------------------!
Tell you what, if you've got time
to prattle questions at me, you've
got time to solve this puzzle!
!******************************!
[e191_t3.txt]
<@1>I thought I made it clear that I've
got nothing to tell you! So stop
your blathering and get solving!
!******************************!
[e191_t4.txt]
<@1>Sorry! I've got nothing for you. No
tips for you, uh-uh.<W>
!------------------------------!
So, do me a favour and stop
all this interrogating!
!******************************!
[e191_t5.txt]
<@1>Oooh, interesting. Now I get it.<W>
!------------------------------!
OK, now you, go away. I've got
nothing for you. N-O-T-H-I-N-G!
Clear?<W> Right, see you.
!******************************!
[e191_t6.txt]
<@1>WHAAAAT?<W>
!------------------------------!
How do you expect to find a missing
person when you can't even solve
a little puzzle?<W> You can't!<W>
!------------------------------!
Let me tell you, if I were you, I'd give
up the missing persons game. Maybe
go into haberdashery instead.
!******************************!
[e191_t7.txt]
<@1>Came back to try again?<W> Of course
you did.
!******************************!
[e192_t0.txt]
As you've come to the village hall,
I strongly advise you to follow
procedure and solve this puzzle.
!******************************!
[e192_t1.txt]
I strongly advise you to retry this
puzzle until you get it right.
!******************************!
[e192_t2.txt]
If you don't have a form to file or
further business here, I strongly
advise that you take your leave.
!******************************!
[e192_t3.txt]
Thank you, that will do nicely.
Now, please vacate the premises.
!******************************!
[e192_t4.txt]
So the puzzle is too hard for you?
Very well then, you'll have to leave.
You're only getting in the way here.
!******************************!
[e193_t0.txt]
There you are, Professor.<W> Would you
help a girl out? I've got something
here I'd like you to look at.<W>
!------------------------------!
I made this darling sandwich for my
special lunch box, but the silly thing
is too big.<W> Can you make it fit?
!******************************!
[e193_t1.txt]
Are you ready to help me cut that
sandwich yet?
!******************************!
[e193_t2.txt]
Running around the village all day
must tire out even a big, strong
man such as yourself.<W>
!------------------------------!
But fret not! Mama Beatrice has
just the cure! I'll be awaiting your
return tonight with a hot meal.
!******************************!
[e193_t3.txt]
Oh, Professor, you're just the
cleverest! Thanks for helping me
work this out.
!******************************!
[e193_t4.txt]
These sandwiches must be a bigger
problem than I initially thought if
even you can't find the answer!
!******************************!
[e194_t0.txt]
Still no luck finding the villain?<W>
!------------------------------!
What an odd world we live in. Well,
you know what they say. Truth IS
stranger than fiction.<W>
!------------------------------!
Speaking of fiction, I just thought
up this little gem! Please give me
your honest feedback on it!
!******************************!
[e194_t1.txt]
Care to try my puzzle again? It's an
awfully good one, isn't it?
!******************************!
[e194_t2.txt]
The muse paid me a visit just now!
I'm thinking about making my next
book an epic adventure.<W>
!------------------------------!
Picture this:<W>
!------------------------------!
A world-famous archaeologist races
the clock and a secret society to
recover a jewel of immense value.<W>
!------------------------------!
In doing so, he must travel deep
within a sinister tower on the edge
of a village.<W>
!------------------------------!
Where do these ideas come from?
Honestly, sometimes my own
brilliance frightens me.
!******************************!
[e194_t3.txt]
Is something hidden in the tower
here in St Mystere?
!******************************!
[e194_t4.txt]
Oh, no, no, there's nothing there
whatsoever.<W>
!------------------------------!
I'm just using the age-old writer's
technique of taking inspiration
from my surroundings.<W>
!------------------------------!
That tower IS intriguing, though.<W>
!------------------------------!
Still, it's best to keep your
distance. I've never heard anything
but bad rumours about the place.
!******************************!
[e194_t5.txt]
Beautiful work!<W> But I think the
puzzles I write into my next novel
will be even harder than that one.<W>
!------------------------------!
If you have time, stop by later. I'm
sure to have an utterly fascinating
puzzle prepared for you by then.
!******************************!
[e194_t6.txt]
It's a hard one, isn't it? Please
come and see me again when you've
worked out the answer.

You're a decent man, Professor.

by odd, I really mean terrifying.<W>

The thing is that I've actually seen
that old man with the big sack
coming out of that tower up north.<W>

I bet you anything you like that
he's the one behind all these
disappearances.<W>

Good luck, fellows. You'll need it.

<@1>Keh heh heh! Now that's what I like
