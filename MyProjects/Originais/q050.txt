That's right!

Everyone in this town gets their hair cut
by one of these two barbers. This includes the
two barbers themselves. Because people
don't usually cut their own hair, the
stylist with the butchered haircut is
probably the more skilled of the two.
!******************************!

Nice one!

As seen in the image above, if you actually
work things out, you'll see that the
salary for Company B will always be 5,000

Company A.
!******************************!
[c_52.txt]
Quite right!

Moving down from the top level, you have one,
four, six and nine boxes. The only boxes you
can't access without rearranging things are
the three indicated in the above picture. 
!******************************!
[c_53.txt]
That's right!

If you can dissect the block in your head
in the way shown above, the answer is easy
enough to come by.

As you can see, the number of small cubes
with one side painted red is six, one for
each face of the larger block.
!******************************!
[c_54.txt]
Very good!

You had 50 sweets in 10 jars, giving
you a total of 500 sweets.
You divided 500 sweets into 20 bags, so
of course the mathematical average of
this will be 25 sweets a bag.  
!******************************!
[c_55.txt]
You are correct!

This puzzle is using time as a framework for
the calculations. If you take six hours away
from 8am, the time becomes 2am.
Move ahead six hours from 8am and
the time becomes 2pm. Therefore, if you
add six hours to 7am, you should arrive
at the answer, 1pm.

You can, of course, start at 8pm and still find
the solution. 
!******************************!
[c_56.txt]
That's right!

Take a look at the diagram for an explanation.
!******************************!
[c_57.txt]
That's right! The answer is B.

Look at the picture to see the route. This
puzzle looks difficult, but working it out
backwards makes it obvious that B is the only
reachable goal square.
!******************************!
[c_58.txt]
Nicely done!

If you look at the dots on the dice as three
rows stacked on top of each other, you can
see that there is a trend in the top row
of dots.

O, OO, OOO... The groups of dots continuing
in an unbroken chain in the top row increase
by one each time. The final set of dots should
be six dots in a row, and you need three more
dots to make that happen. Therefore, the
answer is C.
!******************************!
[c_59.txt]
That's right!

While it may seem like you need to take other
cards into account, no card in the deck,
except for the joker and four aces, plays any
part in calculating the percentage.

Knowing that you only have to deal with five
cards in your calculations, the rest is easy.
You have five cards to flip, and you need one
of those five cards to be last. So your
answer is one out of five, or 20 percent.
!******************************!
[c_60.txt]
That's right! ABCD = 2368.

Since A + C and A x 4 both equal D, then
C must equal A x 3. If C - B = B, then C
must also equal B x 2. The only single-digit
number divisible by both 2 and 3 is 6. Once
you know that C = 6, the rest is easy.
!******************************!
[c_61.txt]
That's right!

If you pay attention to the areas where the
black and white shapes share an edge, the
problem is a snap.
!******************************!
[c_62.txt]
That's right!

If you follow the rules set out in the puzzle,
then it really doesn't matter how you break
up the chocolate. The number of segments
you have increases by one each time you
break a chunk off the sheet.

You start with one segment of chocolate, so
29 breaks later, you should have 30 segments.
!******************************!
[c_63.txt]
Excellent!

Only a strong grasp of the principles of logic
can get you through a puzzle like this.
!******************************!
[c_64.txt]
That's right!

The scale will indicate a weight of less than
100g.

A scale is always set to zero with the weight
of the scale tray included. So when the same
scale is brought to the moon, the tray weighs
one-sixth of what it did when the scale was
set, and the scale will now indicate less than
0g when nothing is in the tray.
!******************************!
[c_65.txt]
That's right!

Of all the designs, only E can be stacked
upon itself.

In a hall like the one described, each event
requires a different number of seats, and
thus a change in seating arrangement.
The stackability of E makes it the best
chair for the job.
!******************************!
[c_66.txt]
That's right! B is telling the truth.

The only way for there to be just one
person telling the truth is if what
B says is true. If A is telling the
truth, then C's statement that B is
a liar also becomes true. On the
other hand, if C is telling the truth,
then B's statement that A is a liar
becomes true. In both cases you end
up with two truth-tellers and one liar,
so the only possible solution is that
B is the one telling the truth.
!******************************!
[c_67.txt]
That's right!

Every suspect accused a different number of
people. If anyone was telling the truth, it had
to be one suspect, no more or less.

The only suspect whose statement fits
that condition is D. It looks like he's a free
man now.

[c_71.txt]
That's right!

The mother is 43 years old.

When the boy's father was two years old, his
mother was one. The next year, he turned
three and she turned two. When you realise
this is the only combination of ages that
yields the ratios mentioned in the puzzle,
everything starts to make sense.
!******************************!
[c_72.txt]
Good job!

B and C were also lying about what happened
even though they themselves didn't break the
glass. Make sure you give those two a good
scolding as well!
!******************************!
[c_73.txt]
That's right!

The beginning of the problem says that the
two men #rsplit the 4-hectare plot of land in
half so they could work independently#x.

In other words, they both had the same
amount of work assigned to them.

Since each person did half the work, the pair
should split [[3C]]po[[3E]]100 right down the middle. Each
person gets [[3C]]po[[3E]]50.
!******************************!
[c_74.txt]
Good thinking!

That merchant had an awfully misleading way of

[c_75.txt]
Very clever!

If the boy simply takes the teacher's orders
at face value, he'd have to spend two hours
a day studying for a full seven days, thus
studying a total of 14 hours.

But if he starts studying just before the
date changes and finishes two hours later, he
can get away with doing a lot less studying. 

In total, the boy only studies two hours
every two days and two hours the last day. So
the answer is eight hours.
!******************************!

Finally, an end to the bickering!

Dividing the land like that doesn't seem very
sensible, but if it keeps the owners happy, you
can't really complain, can you?
!******************************!
[c_82.txt]
That's right! D is the most expensive.

When considering how many sides of each
plant-sized square need to be fenced,
you don't even need to count the length
of fence in order to see that D will
cost the most.

By the way, if you do add up the lengths
for all the allotments, you'll find that
A requires 14 sides be fenced, B 20,
C 18 and D 26. So you should, of course,
choose allotment A.
!******************************!
[c_83.txt]
That's right!

As you can see from the diagram, if the bandit

As a result, no matter how he approaches
exit B, he'll never be able to leave through it.

Tracking down all those tilted squares was
quite fun, wasn't it?
!******************************!
[c_87.txt]
That's right!

If you rotate the middle square 45 degrees as
shown in the picture above, the answer
becomes apparent.

The middle square has half the area of the
large blue square, and the little red square
has half the area of the middle square.
Therefore, the little red square is 
one-fourth the size of the blue square.

The blue square is four times the size of the
red square.

some while counting.

What a tricky puzzle.
!******************************!
[c_90.txt]
Terrific!

It doesn't matter how many times you roll the

That's right! It's 150 square metres.

There are several different ways to find the
answer, but here's an interesting one. By
drawing two lines on the diagram as shown

the same. By moving it from a to b as shown
in Figure 2, you can make two right-angled
triangles.

The rest is easy!

If the security guard takes a path like the

That's right!

Cut the cake as shown here.

The two newly exposed surfaces, along with
the two additional surfaces from the newly

corner of the cake to the first marking, the
puzzle is...a piece of cake!

Everyone in this town has one of these two

The two barbers themselves are no exception
to that statement.

Since they don't cut their own hair, the

If you take the time to add things, this puzzle
can be solved in a minute.

Go on, try and add up how much money you'd
receive from both companies each year for
a few years.
!******************************!
[h_51_2.txt]
For Company A, you can just look at your
yearly salary to get your total income for
the year.

Company B will give you a raise halfway
through the year, so you'll need to calculate
two six-month periods to get your yearly pay.

Which one offers more money?
!******************************!
[h_51_3.txt]
Let's add up how much you'd make in your
first year at either company.

Company A gives you 100,000 for your
first year of work.

Company B gives you 50,000 for your first
half year and then gives you a raise. This
means that for the next six-month period,
you will make 55,000. Add those together
and you have your yearly pay for year one:
105,000.
!******************************!
[h_52_1.txt]
Fourteen boxes are visible in the illustration.
You have to use what you can see to visualise
where the hidden boxes are.

You can clearly see all the boxes in the top
two levels of the pile, so you only need to
worry about the two layers of boxes closest
to the ground. 

!******************************!
[h_52_2.txt]
The boxes are stacked upon each other, so
any box not directly on the ground must
have another box supporting it from below.

Knowing this, you can infer that there are
no fewer than six boxes in the layer that's
second from the bottom, and no fewer than
nine boxes resting directly on the floor. 
!******************************!
[h_52_3.txt]
Working from the ground up, you can deduce
there are nine boxes in the bottom layer, six
boxes in the second layer, four boxes in the
third layer and then one box that rests on
the entire stack. That gives you a total of
20 boxes, which is how many the puzzle says
you have.

With all boxes accounted for, all you need to
do is work out how many of these hidden boxes
are completely surrounded by other boxes
on all sides.
!******************************!
[h_53_1.txt]
Take another look at the picture.

When this big cube is divided, which of the
small cubes do you think will have one
side painted?

At the very least, the corner boxes won't fall
into this category. Every corner box has
three painted sides.
!******************************!
[h_53_2.txt]
As stated in Hint 1, all the corner pieces
of the big cube have three painted sides.

Additionally, with the exception of corner
boxes, all the small cubes that touch
another face of the big cube have two
painted sides.
!******************************!
[h_53_3.txt]
As shown in the diagram, the only small cubes
that have one side painted are the ones
located in the exact centre of each face of
the big cube. Each face of the big cube has
only one of these.
!******************************!
[h_54_1.txt]
Each of the 10 jars holds 50 sweets, making
a total of 500 sweets. You've taken this
mountain of sweets and divided it into 20 bags.

Pretty straightforward so far, right?

If you've made it this far, try reading the
puzzle again carefully.
!******************************!
[h_54_2.txt]
Think carefully. What exactly is the puzzle
asking you?

That's right, you need to work out the
percentage likelihood that there will be an
average of 25 sweets per bag.

That's different from simply asking the
percentage likelihood that a bag contains
25 sweets, isn't it? 
!******************************!
[h_54_3.txt]
This will basically give the answer away,
but since you paid for a hint, let's break it
down, shall we?

Ten jars with 50 sweets to a jar means you
have 500 sweets in total.

If you divide those 500 sweets into 20 bags,
you get 25 sweets... Now think about what
exactly that number signifies.
!******************************!
[h_55_1.txt]
At first, it might look like whoever wrote this
on the board was just terrible at maths, but
the truth is that just about everyone does
calculations like these.

Even you probably do it just about every day.

!******************************!
[h_55_2.txt]
Eight minus six does, of course, equal two.

But under what conditions does adding six to
eight equal two? Here's a hint: when you do
calculations like this, you probably use a
commonplace item that many people have
on hand.
!******************************!
[h_55_3.txt]
In this particular type of calculation, no two
numbers will ever add up to equal a number
higher than 12. This is the most common
method, and the one you probably use daily. 

However, some people use a different method
of calculation where two numbers can add up
to reach totals as high as 24.  
!******************************!
[h_56_1.txt]
If you flip the shape in Diagram A, you get the
shape shown in the upper-right part of the
screen. Try to visualise where that black dot
is when the white side is up.

Diagram B is just a rotated version of
Diagram A, so you know that the position of
the black dot in Diagram B must also
rotate accordingly.
!******************************!
[h_56_2.txt]
When the shape is positioned as shown in A,
the black dot is behind the middle-right prong
of the shape. Flip the shape over and you'll
see it on the middle-left prong.

See how the dot moves when you flip the shape
over? Now think about where that dot should
be in the orientation shown in B.

 
!******************************!
[h_56_3.txt]
Moving clockwise, when the white side is
facing up (as in the left picture of B), the
black dot is two spaces ahead of the red dot.

Now you should pretty much know where the
black dot is. Just visualise the shape flipping
over and you'll have your answer.
!******************************!
[h_57_1.txt]
If you try out all the possible routes from
the starting point, you'll eventually find the
answer. But if you look at the problem a
little differently, it won't take so long!

!******************************!

The rules are actually helpful hints.

You have to land exactly on a goal square...

[h_58_1.txt]
Examine the dice and try to find a reason
or method to their orientation.

You might think that the dice's arrangement
has to do with the total number of dots, but
this puzzle is far simpler than that. Just pay
attention to the way the dots on the dice
line up.
!******************************!
[h_58_2.txt]
Look at the way the dots are lined up.

See how there are three rows of dots stacked
on top of one another?

One of those rows holds the key to
this puzzle.
!******************************!
[h_58_3.txt]
The dots on the dice form three rows that
are stacked on top of each other.

You need to focus on what's going on in the
top row. Scan the row from the left to the
right. Do you notice anything going on?
!******************************!
[h_59_1.txt]
Out of 53 cards, four are aces. Each time you
flip a card, the probability of turning over an
ace increases...but you really don't need to
work out any of that.

Think about what you can do to eliminate
other variables.
!******************************!
[h_59_2.txt]
If you distil this question down to its
simplest form, it's just asking you how
likely it is you'll flip over four aces in
any order before you turn over the joker.

The other 48 cards have nothing to do
with the problem.
!******************************!
[h_59_3.txt]
OK, let's lay it all out on the table,
so to speak.

There are five cards that actually matter in
this puzzle. Of those five, the joker has to
come last. What's the probability of flipping
the joker after the other four cards?
!******************************!
[h_60_1.txt]
Two of the equations have D as their answer.

Your starting point should be to compare
these two equations.
!******************************!
[h_60_2.txt]
A + C and A x 4 both equal D.
Since A x 4 is the same as A + A + A + A,
C must equal A x 3.
!******************************!
[h_60_3.txt]
C - B = B. This means that C = 2 x B. 

You also know from the second hint
that C = 3 x A. 

Only one single-digit number is divisible by 
both 2 and 3. Find it and you've found the
key to solving the puzzle.
!******************************!
[h_61_1.txt]
Here are some helpful facts to keep in mind.
No pentagon shares a side with another
pentagon. Also, there are a total of 12
pentagons on the ball. Since every pentagon
has five sides, there are a total of 60 sides.

All hexagons share three sides with
other hexagons.
!******************************!
[h_61_2.txt]
Pentagons are surrounded on all sides
by hexagons.

You may be tempted to think that there are
60 hexagons because each of the 12
pentagons is surrounded on all five sides by
hexagons. However, that count doesn't add up,
because each hexagon shares three borders
with pentagons.
!******************************!
[h_61_3.txt]
A total of 60 sides on 12 pentagons might
lead you to think that your answer should be
60, but remember that each hexagon touches
three sides from three pentagons.

This means you really only need one hexagon
for every three sides of a pentagon. So just
divide that number you had in mind by three.
!******************************!
[h_62_1.txt]
You might have started by thinking about
different ways to break the chocolate, and
which way will take the fewest breaks.
However, the truth is that no matter how you
break the chocolate, the answer you arrive
at will be the same.
!******************************!
[h_62_2.txt]
Split a sheet of chocolate and you get two
segments where there was only one before.
If you then break one of your two segments,
you get a total of three segments.

Your third break, regardless of what segment
you choose, will yield a total of four segments
of chocolate.

Do you see a pattern here?
!******************************!
[h_62_3.txt]
Since you can't break multiple segments of
chocolate at a time, you increase the total
number of segments you have by one. If you
catch on to that, the rest of the problem
should be a breeze.
!******************************!
[h_63_1.txt]
If the club is to the immediate right of the
heart, the heart can't be the rightmost card.

Neither the diamond nor the spade is next
to the heart. You know that the club is to the
immediate right of the heart. So either the
heart is the leftmost card or the joker lies
to the left of it.
!******************************!
[h_63_2.txt]
The heart is to the immediate left of the club,
and neither the joker nor the diamond is
next to the club. So either the club is the
rightmost card, or the spade lies to the right
of it. Remember, neither the diamond,
the heart or the joker can be next to the 
spade.

Therefore, the spade is the rightmost card
and the club lies to its immediate left.
!******************************!
[h_63_3.txt]
From Hints 1 and 2, you know that from the
right side, the cards appear in this order:
spade, club and heart.

As for the two remaining cards, you know that
the diamond can't be next to the heart, so
the joker must be the fourth card from the
right.
!******************************!

To use a scale, you place the object to be
weighed on top of the tray.

Do you see?
!******************************!
[h_64_2.txt]
If the gravity is one-sixth, then a 600g
object should weight 100g.

But the question is, what weight is indicated
on the scale?

Think about what parts a scale is made up of.
!******************************!
[h_64_3.txt]
When there's nothing on the tray, a scale
will show 0g. But the tray itself also has
a certain weight, you know.

That weight will also be one-sixth on the
moon.
!******************************!
[h_65_1.txt]
As stated earlier, the hall is multipurpose. 
Don't you think that, depending on the size
and nature of a day's event, the number of
chairs needed will change? 
!******************************!
[h_65_2.txt]
When choosing chairs for the home or office,
most people base their selection on comfort
and other factors that affect what the chair
is like when it's in use.

But for this particular application, the most
important aspect of this chair is what you
can do with it when it's #rnot in use#x.
!******************************!
[h_65_3.txt]
Naturally, when a very large group of people
are using the hall, a large number of chairs
are required.

But what about smaller events? When only a
smaller number of chairs are needed, storing
the extra chairs can turn into a big problem.

Which chair makes #rstorage easiest#x?
!******************************!
[h_66_1.txt]
This is a logic puzzle. You know that there is
only one person telling the truth.

First, pick someone and assume they are
telling the truth. With that assumption, does
their statement lead to there being more than
one person telling the truth?

If it does, then you know they must be lying.
!******************************!
[h_66_2.txt]
If you call a liar a liar, you are telling the
truth. B and C are both calling someone a
liar. What does that mean?
!******************************!
[h_66_3.txt]
If A is telling the truth, then B must be a
liar. If B is a liar, then C is also telling the
truth.

That makes two people telling the truth...
!******************************!
[h_67_1.txt]
This puzzle might look like a big mess at
first, but it's fairly simple when all is said
and done.

Take E, for example, who says everyone is
lying. If she is actually telling the truth, then
her statement becomes a lie, and she must
be ruled out. Yep, E's definitely a liar.
!******************************!
[h_67_2.txt]
Let's rule out another couple of suspects. 
If A's statement is true, then three 
other people should be saying the same 
thing as A. This is not the case, so A is a liar.

If B is telling the truth, two other suspects
should say the same thing as B. Once again,
this is not the case, so B must be lying.
!******************************!
[h_67_3.txt]
So, to sum things up, so far we've proven that
A, B, and E are lying. Let's examine the last
two suspects.

If three people are lying, the other two
suspects should have the same statement,
but everyone is saying something different.
On the other hand, if four of the five
suspects are lying...
!******************************!
[h_68_1.txt]
What do you think the numbers assigned to A,
B, C, and D represent? Take another look and
see for yourself.
!******************************!
[h_68_2.txt]
A, B, C, D, and E refer to sections of the
diagram. What separates one section
from another?
!******************************!
[h_68_3.txt]
Focus on the edges between sections and the
possibilities that arise from that line
of thought.
!******************************!
[h_69_1.txt]
Don't lose focus of what's being asked.

Keep in mind that you aren't being asked the
percentage likelihood of you grabbing your
own umbrella from a group of three.
!******************************!
[h_69_2.txt]
If two people have already successfully taken
their own umbrellas, who does the final
umbrella belong to?
!******************************!
[h_69_3.txt]
Three umbrellas sit in a bin. Two people come
by and take their own umbrellas by chance, but
the third person fails to do so... Hey, is that
even possible?

In 20 minutes, the raft can make two
round-trips of nine minutes each.

Where is the raft located after two trips to
the island and back?
!******************************!
[h_70_2.txt]
After two round-trips, the raft returns
to the ship. At this point, 18 minutes have
passed, but since the ship hasn't sunk yet,
there's no reason the raft can't pick up a
few more passengers.

That's right, the raft has time to pick up
three loads of passengers.
!******************************!
[h_70_3.txt]
You now know that the raft has time to pick
up three loads of passengers, so you're
probably raring to answer.

Just be careful, as there is one more trick
to this puzzle that you might not have picked
up on. It's sad to say, but not every
passenger will make it off that ship alive.
!******************************!
[h_71_1.txt]
You just need to find the difference between
the father's age and mother's age.

What age difference allows the father's age
to change from twice the mother's age in one
year to 1.5 times her age the next year?
!******************************!
[h_71_2.txt]
For the father's age to change from twice the
mother's age to 1.5 times the mother's age
in one year, both parents would have had to
be very young at the time. Very, very young.
!******************************!
[h_71_3.txt]
When the mother was one year old...
!******************************!
[h_72_1.txt]
This one's sort of a pain, isn't it?

The child who broke the window is certainly
lying, but you can't forget that #rone or more
of the other children are lying as well#x.

Keep that in mind as you solve this puzzle.
!******************************!
[h_72_2.txt]
We've already established that the child who
actually broke the window lied. Therefore,
the child who broke the window must have
denied breaking the window when confronted.
In other words, B couldn't have broken the
window, and D must be telling the truth
about B. By the way, D didn't do it either.
!******************************!
[h_72_3.txt]
If what A said is true, then C must also be
telling the truth. That would mean none of
the children broke the window, which we know
to be false.

Either A or C had to have broken the window.
!******************************!
[h_73_1.txt]
The two workers receive [[3C]]po[[3E]]100 for the job
and divide it according to the amount of work
each person did. In this case, "work" refers
to #rthe number of hectares each person
seeded#x.

Read the puzzle again and think about exactly
how much work each person did. 
!******************************!
[h_73_2.txt]
Since work refers to #rthe number of hectares
each person seeded#x, the amount of time each
person took isn't a factor in deciding
payment.
!******************************!
[h_73_3.txt]
Did you see the sentence that said that
Roland and Alfred were assigned a
#r4-hectare plot of land to work together
and split it in half#x? What does that tell
you about the amount of work each
person did?
!******************************!
[h_74_1.txt]
This puzzle doesn't require any difficult
calculation, but there is a particularly tricky
aspect to it that trips most people up.

The camera and case cost a total of [[3C]]po[[3E]]310
but #rdiffer in price by [[3C]]po[[3E]]300#x.
!******************************!
[h_74_2.txt]
If you assume that the case costs #rX#x,
then the camera must cost #rX#x plus [[3C]]po[[3E]]300.

This means that the camera itself must cost
#rmore than [[3C]]po[[3E]]300#x.
!******************************!
[h_74_3.txt]
The case and camera cost [[3C]]po[[3E]]310 together.
The camera costs [[3C]]po[[3E]]300 more than the case.

It may seem like the answer is [[3C]]po[[3E]]300 for the
camera and [[3C]]po[[3E]]10 for the case, but if you
do the maths, you'll see that the difference
in price is only [[3C]]po[[3E]]290.

Did you notice that?

One week has seven days. The boy has to study
two hours every day, so the answer must be
14 hours, right?

Come on now, what kind of puzzle would this be
if that was the answer? What you need to do
is brainstorm ways the boy could beat the
system. For example, would starting his daily
studies at an odd hour benefit him at all?
!******************************!
[h_75_2.txt]
"Today" may change to "tomorrow" at midnight,
but time itself continues uninterrupted.

The boy must study every day, but nothing was
said about what time he should start
studying...
!******************************!
[h_75_3.txt]
If the boy really wants to bend the rules, he
should study every other night and begin his
studies less than two hours before midnight,
so that he technically studies for two days
in one session.

This puzzle would be a lot easier if you were
allowed to flip the shapes over as well.
Since you can't, though, here's a
hint to get you started on the right track.

Don't start off by dividing the wood into two
pieces straight through the middle.

!******************************!
[h_77_2.txt]
Have you ever seen a standard office staple?
Well, that's the shape you are looking to cut
out here, except it'll be a bit longer in the
middle than your standard staple.
!******************************!
[h_77_3.txt]
The board is shaped like a large H.

First, cut a staple-shaped piece out of both
of the vertical lines that make up the sides
of the H. Then, draw a line through the
middle of the horizontal line that remains
to separate the last two pieces.
!******************************!
[h_78_1.txt]
To satisfy all the conditions set forth by the
puzzle, you need to cut the chocolate into
four L-shaped pieces.

Now, how to cut it up?
!******************************!
[h_78_2.txt]
It's easy enough to cut the chocolate into
four L-shaped pieces. The problem is getting
those stubborn almonds into the right places!

Try working it out a few times. If two almonds
keep ending up in the same piece of chocolate,
you know you've got to rework your strategy
for cutting up that section.
!******************************!
[h_78_3.txt]
As you can see, there are a total of 16
squares of chocolate that you'll divide up
into four sections of four squares each.

There are only so many ways to arrange four
L-shaped pieces of chocolate into a perfect
square. See if you can brainstorm a few
before you begin cutting.


!******************************!
[h_79_1.txt]
The example shape that the puzzle shows you
(Diagram 2) isn't at all indicative of the shape
you're looking for.

Think about a completely different shape
you'd like to try.
!******************************!
[h_79_2.txt]
The paper has a total area of 15 squares.

Since you're trying to assemble a rectangle,
the only dimensions possible are 3x5
squares or 5x3 squares.
!******************************!
[h_79_3.txt]
Look for a piece that can help you complete a
rectangle that's five squares tall.

Now that you know the height of your
rectangle, you should be able to narrow down
your options a little.

Just trying to clear the cars immediately in
front of the professor's vehicle won't get
you anywhere.

Think about exactly what you need to do to
clear a path to the exit.
!******************************!
[h_80_2.txt]
Don't be afraid to take a step backwards in
order to move two steps forwards. You may
need to move some things into the way to get
them out of the way in the end.

When you're moving cars around, be sure to
keep in mind each car's directional limitations.
!******************************!
[h_80_3.txt]
To start, you'll need to move the two cars
directly in front of the Laytonmobile. In order
to do that, you'll first need to move the
horizontally oriented car that's above
those two vehicles.

Once you've completed that task, move the
Laytonmobile towards the exit. Then
try to rearrange cars at the end of the car
park opposite the exit.
!******************************!
[h_81_1.txt]
The feuding parties have demanded that the
land be divided into four identically-sized
properties. You'll have a much easier time
achieving this if you start all your divisions
from the middle of the large chunk of land.
!******************************!
[h_81_2.txt]
If you find a group of houses or wells
together, you know where one of your
property lines needs to go.

Now you just need to use a little logic to
determine where the lines need to
pass through.
!******************************!
[h_81_3.txt]
The division lines for all four properties run
through the centre of the map.

You'd do well to try dividing things up further
after you've decided how to allot the four
squares in the middle of the map.
!******************************!
[h_82_1.txt]
You can find the answer by adding up the
length of fence around all the allotments, but
there is another way...
!******************************!
[h_82_2.txt]
At first glance, doesn't A look like it has
the shortest length of fence?

Yes, it does!
!******************************!
[h_82_3.txt]
Each individual square has four sides, so
an allotment of 12 squares will have 48
sides in total, with some shared between
squares.

The number of sides being shared by
neighbouring squares will differ greatly
depending on the shape of the allotment.
!******************************!
[h_83_1.txt]
It's hard to get started on a puzzle that
seems to present so many possibilities,
but you'd be surprised at how much you
can learn by simply trying out the various
routes through town.

The paths are littered with twists and turns,
but if you try tracing any of the given paths,
you can see how the bandit would make his
way through town.

!******************************!
[h_83_2.txt]
To simplify the question, what you're really
looking for is an exit that's positioned so
that the bandit has to turn away from it
every time he draws near.

Do you see any place like that on the map?
!******************************!
[h_83_3.txt]
If you've tried any of the paths near the
entrance the bandit came from, you know
that the bandit can escape via A, E, F and G.

Your answer is one of the other three exits.
!******************************!

Since you have seven pigs to separate
and only three ropes, it's basically a given
that the ropes will have to overlap in places.

Go ahead and hitch the ropes up a couple
of times. You might just find the answer.
!******************************!
[h_84_2.txt]
Look at how the seven pigs are arranged. Do
you see the one pig in the middle? In order to
separate him from the other pigs, you're going
to have to surround him with rope on all sides.

Your three ropes need to be arranged in such
a way that they surround and isolate the
middle pig.
!******************************!
[h_84_3.txt]
Arrange your three ropes so that the little
pig in the middle is surrounded completely.

Next, look at how your ropes are laid out.
You need to keep the middle pig surrounded,
but you also need to separate the other pigs.
There aren't many configurations that will
satisfy those conditions, so you should have
the answer before you know it.
!******************************!
[h_85_1.txt]
There are no equilateral pentagons within the
shape, so all the ones you do find will have at
least two sides with different lengths. Count
each one you spot.
!******************************!
[h_85_2.txt]
Count every five-sided shape you can find!
Each pentagon you spot can be reproduced on
a different section of the picture by
rotating the image 90 degrees. This means
that for every type of pentagon you find,
you've actually found four.
!******************************!
[h_85_3.txt]
Surround the square in the middle of the
picture with triangles from within the 
picture to make different pentagons.

Make a special effort to look for pentagons
formed by attaching multiple triangles to the
square in the picture. These are usually the
hardest to spot.



!******************************!
[h_86_1.txt]
Most of the squares you make will be tilted
45 degrees to the side, and their sizes will
vary as well.

Start by looking for pins you can connect to
create squares tilted at an angle.
!******************************!
[h_86_2.txt]
You want more specifics? All right, here's the
location of one of the squares. Connect the
four pins in the top-left corner to form a
tiny square.

Just so you know, this is the only square on
the board that isn't tilted.
!******************************!
[h_86_3.txt]
The largest square contains the pin that's
third from the top on the left column and the
bottom pin from the far-right column.

You also need to form a small diagonal block
using the two pins lined up diagonally on the
bottom-left portion of the board. There are
two more small squares just like this one on
the board.

!******************************!
[h_87_1.txt]
Do you see the circle that touches the sides
of the big blue square?

A smaller square sits inside the circle and
touches it. Since the square is smaller than
the circle, you can rotate it within the
circle. 
!******************************!
[h_87_2.txt]
If you rotate the middle square 45 degrees,
its corners will touch the sides of the
large blue square.

At the same time, notice that when you
perform this rotation, the red square's
corners make contact with the middle square.

Having trouble visualising the rotation? Try
drawing it on the Touch Screen.

!******************************!
[h_87_3.txt]
From the rotation described in Hint 2, draw
two perpendicular lines from the outer circle
through the middle to divide the squares into
four quadrants.

Do this and you'll see that the middle square's
area is equal to half that of the blue square.
Try it for yourself.
!******************************!
[h_88_1.txt]
The original cross in this problem is composed
of 24 pins.

The board contains a total of 49 pins.
Subtract the 16 pins on the outside and the
17 on the inside and you get 16, the number of
pins that will make up your cross.
!******************************!
[h_88_2.txt]
There are only a few ways you can place a
cross containing 16 pins on the board.

When you think you're onto something but
don't have quite enough space to draw
your cross, you should try something a
little bit different.

Like maybe changing the orientation of
your cross...
!******************************!
[h_88_3.txt]
The cross has to be oriented diagonally on
the board.

Now you just need to decide how big to make
your cross. Make sure you draw it to include
the right number of pins!
!******************************!
[h_89_1.txt]
There's no trick to this one. No, really! All you
need to do is count them up.
!******************************!
[h_89_2.txt]
The number 9 shows up in 9, 19, 29, etc.
Every time you go up by 10, you'll find another
9, but don't think you've got the answer
just yet. There are more than ten 9s for
you to find.
!******************************!
[h_89_3.txt]
Remember that all the numbers from 90 to 99
contain 9 as well. 

That should be all you need to know, so go
ahead and count those 9s up.
!******************************!
[h_90_1.txt]
Doesn't it seem like the longer a puzzle
explanation is, the more likely you are to find
a trick in the wording?

Read the explanation carefully and pay
attention to what exactly it is that you're
being asked to answer.

You shouldn't need to calculate anything to
find your answer.
!******************************!
[h_90_2.txt]
Don't bother multiplying 216 by six again. This
puzzle is much easier than that.
!******************************!
[h_90_3.txt]
It doesn't matter what numbers appeared in
the three previous rolls.

The puzzle is asking you what the probability
is of a three showing up in the next roll.
!******************************!
[h_91_1.txt]
There are multiple correct answers, so the
best thing to do is just work patiently
until you find a solution.

If you don't have the patience for that,
here's a more obvious hint: you can eliminate
the 5 tile.
!******************************!
[h_91_2.txt]
The 5 isn't used in your answer, nor is the 7.

Now that you know the seven tiles you need to
work with, see if you can find the answer.
!******************************!
[h_91_3.txt]
When you multiply each row of numbers, they
should all equal 72.

If you still feel like you could use a hint,
here's one more. Place the 2 in the central
slot of the lock.
!******************************!
[h_92_1.txt]
Your first priority should be to get all the
balls switched over to their matching zones.

Once you've moved the balls to their correct
zones, you can worry about arranging them in
the proper order.
!******************************!
[h_92_2.txt]
You are going to have to be a little methodical
in your approach to this puzzle.

You can stumble upon the answer by just
moving things around, but the puzzle is much
easier to finish when you create rules for
yourself to operate by.

Make sure you aren't just repeating the same
unsuccessful moves each time you start
moving balls around.
!******************************!
[h_92_3.txt]
It's easy to move balls around without
thinking, but that'll get you nowhere.
Remember to stay focused on your
goal when moving things around. The
truth is that experimenting with the puzzle
is more useful than any hint you could get,
but since you paid for it, here's one more.

You have very little room to work with. As
you've probably worked out, there's a single
spot in the middle where you can stash a
ball, so make good use of it.
!******************************!
[h_93_1.txt]
Let's review the method for finding the
area of a right-angled triangle. You simply
multiply the lengths of the two sides that
make the right angle, and divide by 2.

You can use this method to solve the puzzle.
!******************************!
[h_93_2.txt]
The only lengths you know for the square-
shaped estate are 10m and 20m, so it should
be easy to work things out. From the corner
to the 10m point is half the length of a side
of the square.

By drawing extra lines from these points, you
can easily find the answer.
!******************************!
[h_93_3.txt]
It's difficult to work out the area of the
triangle directly, but it's a lot easier to find
the areas of the three smaller triangles
surrounding it.

If you find those areas and subtract them
from the area of the square, you'll have the
area of the large triangle.

Although there is an even better way...
!******************************!
[h_94_1.txt]
If it weren't against the rules for this
puzzle, it would be easy to just switch the
second and fourth glasses with each other.

But since you can only pick up one glass at
a time, that idea is right out.
!******************************!
[h_94_2.txt]
You have to move things around so that there
is juice in every other glass. Surely there's a
way to do this that doesn't involve switching
the glasses themselves around.
!******************************!
[h_94_3.txt]
You don't need to change the positions of the
actual glasses. You can achieve the same goal
by just moving the juice from one glass to
another.

So, bearing this in mind, how many glasses do
you need to pick up to complete the puzzle?
!******************************!
[h_95_1.txt]
First off, ignore the sample path
shown on the screen.

Here's an additional hint for you. Nowhere
within the problem does it say the guard can
only enter each room once. It's OK for your
path to move back through a previously
visited room.
!******************************!
[h_95_2.txt]
Has the layout of the rooms and the sample
path shown made you feel like all your turns
need to be 90 degrees?

This puzzle wants you to find the solution with
the fewest number of turns. This means that
movement will always be in a straight line, but
the angle of any given turn is up to you.
!******************************!
[h_95_3.txt]
There's no reason the guard should have to
enter the exhibit at an angle parallel to the
room. Consider a path that starts with the
guard entering from a 45-degree angle.

Don't forget, you can move through the
same room twice.
!******************************!
[h_96_1.txt]
Don't spend too much time trying to think
it through. Instead, just move those brothers
around and see what develops.

There are only three seats 2 can sit in,
because he can't sit next to 1. Put 2 in any
one of those seats and move on to 3. We know
that 3 can't sit next to 2... And so on.


!******************************!
[h_96_2.txt]
This puzzle would be a breeze if it weren't for
the spat between brothers 3 and 5.
What a pain they are.

Sit 3 next to 1. That ought to keep him in line.
!******************************!
[h_96_3.txt]
You already know to sit 3 next to 1.

Next, sit 4 directly across the table from 1.

The rest is up to you.
!******************************!
[h_97_1.txt]
You can only produce two new surfaces by
cutting the cake. Where do you need to cut
the cake in order to make these cross-
sections appear square?

When you work that out, you've basically got
the answer. Recall what the puzzle said about
the thickness of the cake.
!******************************!
[h_97_2.txt]
It's obvious that the two exposed surfaces
that result from your cut will serve as two
of your four square sides. Where do you think
the other two sides will come from?
!******************************!
[h_97_3.txt]
In order for the two surfaces you cut
between to come out as squares, you need
to cut the cake at a point where the length
of the piece equals the thickness of the cake.

Do you have an idea where that might be?
!******************************!
[h_98_1.txt]
This slide puzzle only has eight tiles, so don't
be intimidated. Take your time with it.

If you aren't seeing much progress, try
something new with each move. Don't get
stuck moving tiles in the same pattern
again and again.
!******************************!
[h_98_2.txt]
Have you noticed that a few of the tiles
look very similar to some others? Focus
your attention on those.
!******************************!
[h_98_3.txt]
If you're still having trouble, start by moving
the tile in the upper-left corner out of its
starting location. You can't finish the puzzle
without doing so.
!******************************!
[h_99_1.txt]
Thinking in fractions is the key to success.
!******************************!
[h_99_2.txt]
As Hint 1 suggested, don't try to work out
this puzzle using arithmetic.

Within the parentheses, you will encounter
some odd fractions. Keep these in fraction
form for the remainder of the problem. 

When all is said and done, as long as your
numerator is 10 times larger than your
denominator, you've found your answer.
!******************************!
[h_99_3.txt]
The eight goes in the rightmost slot.

Your goal is to arrange the numbers so that
everything to the left of the equal sign
