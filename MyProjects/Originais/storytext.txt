[d_1.txt]
A most fascinating letter found its way
to me the other day. It came to me from
one Lady Dahlia, widow to Baron Augustus
Reinhold. Her letter details how an
unusual object known only as the Golden
Apple is to decide how her late
husband's fortune is split up. The entire
matter sounds terribly interesting, and
I've arranged for Luke to accompany me
on a visit to St Mystere, the site of the
whole incident.
!******************************!
[d_10.txt]
After talking with that boisterous fellow
Jarvis, we learned that a man by the
name of Zappone may have some
information for us. He's apparently
hanging about the area past the gate,
where the road forks.
!******************************!
[d_11.txt]
After talking to Zappone, one thing is
certain. The man certainly has a talent
for sounding like he has valuable
information, which is to say, he didn't
know much of anything.
Oh, well. At least he let us know we
should seek out Crouton, the owner of
the restaurant down by the park, for
more information.
!******************************!
[d_12.txt]
The rumour mill is churning. Feeding the
frenzy are the disturbing number of
disappearances and the thunderous
booming that is said to emanate from
the tower above St Mystere. To top it
off, Crouton says there is a shadowy
figure running around kidnapping
people. We need to visit the local cafe
to find out more.
!******************************!
[d_13.txt]
Our investigation continues even as
night falls upon St Mystere. We were on
our way to the cafe through the
passage below the clock tower when we
bumped into Gerard, who was in a spot of
bother. He said he dropped something of
great value near the park, but is scared
of venturing out alone at night. As I
always tell Luke, a gentleman's first
duty is to help those around him, so
we've offered to aid in the search.
!******************************!
[d_14.txt]
Deke pointed us in Beatrice's direction,
as she was the one who actually found
Gerard's lost watch. Poor Deke really
was stuck when we found him. Though
terrified of being out in the dark, he
refused to go home until he solved a
puzzle that was bothering him.

I suppose we should pay Beatrice a visit.
!******************************!
[d_15.txt]
Beatrice said that Ramon frequents 
a small cafe in the village and that
we might be able to find him there. She
also gave us Gerard's lost watch.

As soon as we return the watch to its
owner, we can get back to our
investigation in a timely manner.
!******************************!
[d_16.txt]
With Gerard's watch returned, we are
finally free to return to our
investigation of Ramon's disappearance.
I must admit that I'm feeling a bit weary
and do hope we will find him at the cafe.
!******************************!
[d_17.txt]
The cafe owner, Crumm, was extremely
helpful. He told us where we can find a
man who had a run-in with the aged
kidnapper. This witness lives just north
of the cafe.
I hope against hope that Ramon is merely
off somewhere napping, but I have a
dreadful feeling that the worst has
happened... In any case, I must talk to
this Prosciutto.
!******************************!
[d_18.txt]
To our shock, we stumbled across the
very kidnapper we were investigating
just as he nabbed Ramon and dashed off.
We tried to report our findings to the
inspector forthwith, but just as we
were about to reveal our findings, to
our bewilderment, Ramon returned home.

Just what is going on here? 
!******************************!
[d_19.txt]
Today marks our second day in St
Mystere, and I was secretly hoping I
could start the day off properly with a
little tea, but no such luck.

We've been summoned to Reinhold Manor
and must hurry over to meet the
inspector before he loses his patience.
!******************************!
[d_2.txt]
A thunderous noise rang out during my
conversation with Lady Dahlia. The din
was so deafening that it caused her cat,
Claudia, to run off.
Losing her cat put Lady Dahlia in quite a
temper, so we have taken on the rather
irritating task of chasing a wayward
feline. But enough of cats. Just what
was that noise?
!******************************!
[d_20.txt]
Chelmey was shouting at Matthew for
bringing him cakes when we arrived,
and was also angry that we'd been 
conducting an investigation that runs
parallel to his own. As much as
I'd like to help find Simon's killer, there
are other matters we should attend to
first. Namely, checking in on Ramon to
see what, if anything, he remembers of
last night.
!******************************!
[d_21.txt]
I had hoped Ramon would remember
something of last night, but it's as I
feared, he remembers nothing. How could
someone go through something as
jarring as a kidnapping and remember
nothing of it?

For now, I must put my curiosity aside
and return to our search for the Golden
Apple. Perhaps Matthew can tell us
something.
!******************************!
[d_22.txt]
Talking with Matthew revealed that the
Reinholds formerly had another servant
in their employ. Unless I'm mistaken,
Matthew was referring to Ingrid, the
nanny in that old photo we saw earlier.

She is usually out by the village shop
at this time of day, so finding her
shouldn't prove too difficult.
!******************************!
[d_23.txt]
Ingrid told us the story of how Flora's
mother passed from this world. The
baron must have truly loved his former
wife, for her grave lies within his
garden, presumably so that, even in
death, she could stay close to him.
!******************************!
[d_24.txt]
Lady Viola's grave is a truly beautiful
place. The baron's devotion and love for
her is reflected in every detail of the
place.

Matthew mentioned that the baron kept
a diary detailing his thoughts. If we can
find it, I imagine there is much we could
learn from its pages.
!******************************!
[d_25.txt]
The pages of Baron Reinhold's diary were
filled with passages reflecting upon his
deep love for his child and late wife.
We also discovered that the baron
left a note disclosing the location of
the Golden Apple in the possession of
a good friend of his.

Perhaps Ingrid knows this friend of the
baron's?
!******************************!
[d_26.txt]
Sadly, even Ingrid, despite her intimate
ties with the Reinhold family, seemed
to know nothing that would help our
investigation.

Ingrid recommended we pay Zappone a
visit, and so we shall. Really, though,
does that man ever have anything useful
to say?
!******************************!
[d_27.txt]
As I suspected, Zappone hadn't a single
piece of good advice for us regarding
the baron's mystery friend.

If we are to find the individual we seek,
it looks like we'll need to rely on the
time-honoured technique of taking to
the streets and talking to the villagers.
!******************************!
[d_28.txt]
While talking with Giuseppe in the market,
I stumbled upon a newspaper article
outlining the inspector's latest collar.
As I turned to leave the market, I
bumped into a man named Archibald who
claims to have been a friend of 
the baron's. It turns out the baron
bequeathed a desk to Archibald. I simply
can't wait to take a look at it up close.
!******************************!
[d_29.txt]
Archibald was kind enough to invite us to
examine the desk he received from the
baron. Sure enough, hidden inside the
desk was a note that seems to have
something to do with the location of the
Golden Apple.

I'll investigate the note in more detail
later, but for now, Beatrice has asked
us to return to the inn, and we mustn't
keep her waiting.
!******************************!
[d_3.txt]
Some rascal has made off with the crank
to the village drawbridge. For the
moment, it seems that we are unable to
leave St Mystere.
Though we're still out looking for that
cat, I've decided we should make lodging
arrangements before it gets too late. I
recall seeing an inn around the village
entrance.
!******************************!
[d_30.txt]
Beatrice called us to the inn to tell us
about a guest who had the audacity to
leave without paying. It seems we aren't
the only outsiders around. I'll be sure
to help Beatrice when the time is right,
but first I want to investigate the road
in the northern part of the village.
!******************************!
[d_31.txt]
Moments after we arrived in the
northern part of the village, a girl
appeared before us. From her
expression, it was clear she had a
message for us, but something in the
shadows frightened her off before she
could say anything.

She did, however, leave behind a clue,
namely a single ticket to the village's
Ferris wheel.
!******************************!
[d_32.txt]
Spurred on by the Ferris wheel ticket
the young girl left behind, Luke and I
tried to gain access to the park, but
its gate was locked shut.

Perhaps that man from the village hall,
Rodney, can help us get the gate open.
!******************************!
[d_33.txt]
It seems the only person who can get us
into the park is the park caretaker. Now
if we could only find the man.

Rodney mentioned that the caretaker
had the additional duty of looking after
the village sewer systems. Maybe the
caretaker is below ground today?
!******************************!
[d_34.txt]
It took a trip into the sewers to do it,
but we finally succeeded in locating the
park caretaker. He was quite pleasant
to deal with and consented to open the
park for us after we helped him with a
slightly problematic puzzle.

Now that the gate is finally open, we can
set about exploring the park. 
!******************************!
[d_35.txt]
The silence of the park was so
unnatural, it was hard to believe that
this was ever a place of recreation. All
existing structures are deserted, or, in
the case of one small shack, locked shut.

If there is useful information to be
found here, I don't see it yet. But I
believe the Ferris wheel warrants a look.
!******************************!
[d_36.txt]
Luke and I searched every crevice of
that Ferris wheel, but it failed to yield
any information about the Golden Apple.
What's more, it inexplicably broke free
from its supports and chased us around
the park! We were lucky enough to
escape with our lives, but the shack to
the north was completely decimated.
At least now we can see what lies
beneath the shack. Could it be an
underground tunnel to the tower?
!******************************!
[d_37.txt]
Who would have imagined that the tiny
shack held the entrance to an
underground tunnel and a quaint
storage room?

More unexpected still was our discovery
of a small key shaped like the tower
itself. Could this odd little key truly
unlock a path to the tower?
!******************************!
[d_38.txt]
Luke keeps pushing for us to proceed
straight to the dead end by the tower,
but before we do, I have a suspicion of
my own that I feel the need to confirm.

Before we go anywhere else, I think it
best we stop by the inn. I think we might
be able to identify the person that has
been watching us all this time.
!******************************!
[d_39.txt]
In order to confirm my hunch, I asked
Beatrice to lend me the last few days'
worth of newspapers, but it seems that
someone has made off with the whole
stack. Those papers would have been the
decisive proof needed to confirm my
suspicions, but I'll have to go on without
them. I'd like to continue searching for
the papers, but the inspector has
summoned us, so I'll have to give up on
that for now.
!******************************!
[d_4.txt]
We've succeeded in procuring rooms for
the night, but the village's only inn
is undergoing renovations. As such, we'll
stay in the attic. At least I know we'll
be safe; the innkeeper is a sturdy woman
who no doubt knows how to wield a rolling
pin should the need arise.

Now back to looking for that cat...
!******************************!
[d_40.txt]
En route to the mansion, we ran into
that shawled girl again. I meant to ask
her many things, but she vanished
moments after she appeared. She stayed
just long enough to warn us to stay
away from the tower.

Arriving at the manor, I noticed
something peculiar about Matthew's
expression today. Why has the inspector
called us here? 
!******************************!
[d_41.txt]
Behind the vinyl mask, the man who had
posed as the inspector all this time was
none other than the brilliant scientist
Don Paolo. It seems he, too, was after
the Reinhold fortune.

He alluded to some larger mystery at
work here in the village, and I'm fairly
certain I know which one he means.
!******************************!
[d_42.txt]
Using the key we found beneath the
waterside shack and the note in
Archibald's desk, we have managed to
open a path to the tower.

I am relieved that we have finally made
true progress in our investigation, but
this is no time to revel. What mysteries
await inside?
!******************************!
[d_43.txt]
After a bit of a tumble, we came face-
to-face with the man who abducted
Ramon. The man, Bruno, laid out the bare
truth for us. This village was, as I
suspected, constructed from scratch.

Now I am certain that the treasure we
seek waits for us at the top of this
tower.
!******************************!
[d_44.txt]
After a seemingly endless climb and
several trying puzzles, we've at long
last reached the top floor. Awaiting our
arrival there was Flora, the baron's
daughter and the true Golden Apple.

It seems that, in accordance with her
father's wishes, she has been living
quietly in this tower and waiting for
Luke and I to reach the top.
!******************************!
[d_45.txt]
With the secrets of St Mystere finally
brought to light, I think Luke has begun
to doubt whether there really was a
fortune to be found in the first place.

But I still believe in its existence and,
unless I'm mistaken, the baron has
hidden it somewhere right under our
noses.
!******************************!
[d_5.txt]
It was a long struggle that cost Luke
some scratches to his face and perhaps
his pride, but we finally managed to
catch Claudia.
I think now it would be appropriate to
make our way back to the mansion and
inform Lady Dahlia of our success.
!******************************!
[d_6.txt]
Upon our return to Reinhold Manor, we
were greeted with the awful news of
Simon's murder. Ramon was also
subsequently nowhere to be found.
Seeing Lady Dahlia's distress, I've
agreed to search the village for her
missing servant. The inspector
investigating the murder seems to
think I had something to do with it.
!******************************!
[d_7.txt]
A large gate bars the way through the
base of the clock tower. In order to
investigate the north side of the
village, it is imperative that we make our
way through that gate. But how do we
get through?
!******************************!
[d_8.txt]
A positively gargantuan gentleman named
Deke stands in front of the clock tower
gate and refuses to let anyone through
who hasn't solved 12 puzzles. That's
easy enough, but it is a bit odd...
Everyone in this village seems to have a
curiously strong affinity for puzzles.
!******************************!
[d_9.txt]
We've finally succeeded in passing
through the gate and have made our way
to the north of the village. The roads
here are winding and narrow. Surely one
of these people knows something of
Ramon's whereabouts. I'll be sure to ask
around.
!******************************!
[id_1.txt]
The late Baron Reinhold hid this item in
St Mystere just before dying, and has
promised the whole of his fortune to the
one who finds it.

No one has any clue what the Golden Apple
might be or where it is hidden.
!******************************!
[id_10.txt]
Deep underground on the edge of
the village, the professor and Luke 
found an unusual key shaped like 
the tower. While the connection between 
the key and the tower seems certain, 
what the key unlocks remains a mystery.
!******************************!
[id_11.txt]
The Golden Apple turned out to be Flora,
the daughter of Baron Reinhold.

The name and legend surrounding the
Golden Apple were created by the baron
to help him find a suitable guardian
for his daughter.
!******************************!
[id_12.txt]
The noise that shook the mansion and
scared off Claudia was caused by
Don Paolo's flying machine making an
emergency crash landing in St Mystere.
!******************************!
[id_13.txt]
Bruno, caretaker to all of St Mystere,
was the one who stole the crank for the
bridge. His intent was to prevent Layton
and Luke from leaving the village, so they
would seek out the Golden Apple and fulfil
the late Baron Reinhold's last wish.
!******************************!
[id_14.txt]
The small cogs recovered by Layton and
Luke came loose from Simon and Ramon
when they collapsed. The cogs, along
with the mysterious disappearances he
observed around the village, convinced
Layton that all the villagers in
St Mystere were robots.
!******************************!
[id_15.txt]
It's revealed that Lady Dahlia is a
robot originally constructed to
resemble and behave like the
baron's late wife in every way
imaginable.

Along with her grave in the grounds
of the mansion, this was another
tribute to the baron's love for Viola.
!******************************!
[id_16.txt]
The abductions around the village were
actually the work of Bruno, who moved
under the cover of night to retrieve
his broken robots. Bruno would bring
robots back to the tower to repair them
and then return them to the village.
As none of the villagers knew they were
actually robots, it's only natural that
they were terrified by the strange
old man.
!******************************!
[id_17.txt]
The loud noise emanating from the
tower was the whirring of the machines
Bruno used to repair the robots of
St Mystere.

It's been several years since the
creation of St Mystere. Maintenance
becomes necessary more frequently as
machines age, hence the reports of
increased noise at night from the
villagers.
!******************************!
[id_18.txt]
As a robot with several years on him,
it was only natural that Ramon would
break down sooner or later.
He was quickly taken in for repair,
then promptly returned to the village,
blissfully unaware that he had just
undergone a tune-up.
!******************************!
[id_19.txt]
What a shock! Who could have imagined
that Don Paolo, self-proclaimed
arch-enemy of the professor, was posing
as the Inspector in an effort to steal
the Reinhold fortune? The true Inspector
Chelmey never set foot in St Mystere
and is probably at home in London
enjoying tea and cakes right now.
!******************************!
[id_2.txt]
When the professor first met Lady
Dahlia, Reinhold Manor was rocked
by a noise so loud it shook the walls of
the mansion and scared off Claudia.

What could the source of that noise be?
!******************************!
[id_20.txt]
The note left by the baron in Archibald's
desk gave Layton the clue he needed to
realise the key would fit into the wall
in the north of the village. From there,
the professor and Luke could access
the path to the tower.
!******************************!
[id_3.txt]
Someone has stolen the crank that
controls St Mystere's drawbridge,
the sole portal in and out of the village.
Until the crank is recovered, there is
no way to leave the village.

Why would somebody want to steal a
drawbridge crank?
!******************************!
[id_4.txt]
A small cog with an intricately carved
insignia was recovered from the scene of
Simon's murder. Perhaps the murderer
dropped it when fleeing the scene.
!******************************!
[id_5.txt]
Baron Reinhold's late wife Viola is
pictured cradling a baby in a
photograph on Lady Dahlia's desk.
While the two women seem to be
complete strangers to each other,
their resemblance to each other is
too uncanny to be a coincidence.

What's really going on here?
!******************************!
[id_6.txt]
Rumour has it that a number of villagers
have disappeared recently. Oddly
enough, those who disappear (or are
abducted, as some suggest) often do
so after complaining of general fatigue
or other minor health issues.
!******************************!
[id_7.txt]
Walking the streets of St Mystere at
night, a thunderous rumbling occasionally
fills the air. The noise is rumoured to
come from the tower, but no one
seems to know the origin of the sound.
Villagers claim that the noise has
increased in frequency as of late.
!******************************!
[id_8.txt]
When Layton and Luke finally tracked
down Ramon, they were shocked to see
him being kidnapped by an old man.
Shortly thereafter, Ramon returned to
the mansion with no memory of ever being
abducted or stuffed into a sack.
What's happened to Ramon's memory?
!******************************!
[id_9.txt]
Though Chelmey claims to dislike all
sweets, a scrap of newspaper Luke found
claims that his favourite food in all the
world is cakes.
That being the case, why did Chelmey fly
into such a rage when Matthew brought
him cakes at the manor?
