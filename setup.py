"""Minimal GTK setup.py for cx_Freeze, GObject-Introspection on MSYS2.
To build from the MINGW64 or MINGW32 shell:
    $ rm -fr build && python2 setup.py build_exe
To run from the Windows command line:
    X:\\> cd path\\to\\build\exe.mingw-2.7 && hellogtk && cd\\ || cd\\
This setup script only supports build_exe.
